### Signature Updates
**Purpose:** Minimize number of false positives

**Update Requirements:**
- **Regular Updates** - Update signatures regularly
- **Latest Signatures** - Use latest available signatures

- **Custom Signatures** - Develop custom signatures for specific environments

## Prioritization

### Vulnerability Prioritization
**Principle:** Not every vulnerability shares the same priority

**Priority Factors:**
- **Severity Levels** - Some may not be significant
- **Critical Issues** - Others may be critical
- **Business Impact** - Consider business impact
- **Exploitability** - Consider exploitability

**Prioritization Methods:**
- **Risk-Based** - Prioritize based on risk
- **CVSS Scoring** - Use CVSS scores for prioritization
- **Business Impact** - Consider business impact
- **Exploitability** - Consider exploitability factors

## CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)

### Scoring System
**Definition:** Synchronized with the CVE List

**Purpose:** Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

**CVSS Components:**
- **Base Score** - Intrinsic characteristics of vulnerability
- **Temporal Score** - Characteristics that change over time
- **Environmental Score** - Characteristics specific to environment

**Base Metrics:**
- **Attack Vector** - How vulnerability can be exploited
- **Attack Complexity** - Complexity of attack
- **Privileges Required** - Privileges required for exploitation
- **User Interaction** - User interaction required

**Impact Metrics:**
- **Confidentiality Impact** - Impact on confidentiality
- **Integrity Impact** - Impact on integrity
- **Availability Impact** - Impact on availability

**Scoring Benefits:**
- **Standardization** - Standardized vulnerability scoring
- **Comparability** - Compare vulnerabilities across systems
- **Prioritization** - Prioritize vulnerabilities effectively
- **Risk Assessment** - Assess risk consistently

## CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)

### Vulnerability Database
**Definition:** Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

**Purpose:** Cross-reference vulnerabilities online

**Database Features:**
- **Comprehensive Coverage** - Many resources available
- **Standardized Identifiers** - Standardized vulnerability identifiers
- **Detailed Information** - Detailed vulnerability information
- **Cross-References** - Cross-references to other databases

**CVE Benefits:**
- **Standardization** - Standardized vulnerability identification
- **Information Sharing** - Facilitate information sharing
- **Tool Integration** - Integrate with security tools
- **Research Support** - Support vulnerability research

**Usage:**
- **Vulnerability Tracking** - Track vulnerabilities across systems
- **Tool Integration** - Integrate with security tools
- **Reporting** - Use in security reports
- **Research** - Support vulnerability research

## Vulnerability Classification

### Classification Methods
**Key Principle:** Signatures are key for classification

**Classification Types:**
- **Application Scans** - Classify application vulnerabilities
- **Web Application Scans** - Classify web application vulnerabilities
- **Network Scans** - Classify network vulnerabilities
- **System Scans** - Classify system vulnerabilities

**Classification Criteria:**
- **Severity** - Classify by severity level
- **Type** - Classify by vulnerability type
- **Impact** - Classify by impact level
- **Exploitability** - Classify by exploitability

**Benefits:**
- **Organization** - Organize vulnerabilities effectively
- **Prioritization** - Prioritize vulnerabilities
- **Reporting** - Generate meaningful reports
- **Management** - Manage vulnerabilities efficiently

## Exposure Factor

### Business Impact Assessment
**Definition:** Loss of value or business activity if vulnerability is exploited

**Measurement:** Usually expressed as a percentage

**Examples:**
- **Small DDoS** - May limit access to a service
- **Buffer Overflow** - May disable a service (100%)
- **Data Breach** - May cause significant business impact
- **Service Disruption** - May disrupt business operations

**Factors:**
- **Business Criticality** - Criticality of affected systems
- **Data Sensitivity** - Sensitivity of affected data
- **Service Availability** - Impact on service availability
