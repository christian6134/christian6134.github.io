#### **Open Permissions**
----
- Very easy to leave a door open
- Hackers will find this
- `Statistical chance` of finding an open permission

**Example**
- 14 million verizon records found on the internet `open and available`
- Amazon S3 data repository without any security

*Whats the fix for Open permissions?*
- Secure your permissions


#### Unauthorized Admin Accounts
-----
Administrators use a very easy password to guess on the account.
- Susceptible to brute force attacks

*How can we prevent?*
- Disable direct login to the root account
- Require a user account ---> then su into root account
- Have minimal accounts (limit the scope of the account)


#### Insecure Protocols
----
Some protocols are `not encrypted`
- All traffic sent is readable
- Telnet, FTP, SMTP, IMAP

Use secure version of the protocol

*How can we verify?*
- Perform a `packet capture`
- View everything sent over the network



#### Default Settings
-----
Every application and network has a `default login`
- Not all of these are changed
- Botnets can take advantage of default account names and passwords for IoT devices



#### Open ports and services
----
Services `open ports`
- Manage access
- Giving a little bit of access to a portion of the server

*How are they managed?*
- Often managed with a firewall
- Manage traffic flows
- Allow / deny rules

Firewall rulesets can be complex
- It is easy to make a mistake on the firewall configuration
