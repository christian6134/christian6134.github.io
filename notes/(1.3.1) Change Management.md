- Avoid downtime
- Confusion
- Mistakes

**Typical Approval Process**
--------
- Complete request forms -> provide standard information
- Determine purpose of the change (Why is this occurring)

### Ownership

- Data corruption

Risks if you don't make the change?
- Security vulnerability
- Application unavailability 
- Unexpected Downtime



### Test Results
--------
Sandbox testing environment
- No connection to the real world or real production system
- Technological safe space

Use before making a change to production
- Try the upgrade, apply the patch
- Test and confirm before deployment

Confirm **back** **out** plan
- Move everything back to original
- Sandbox can't consider every possibility

Always have a way to **revert your changes**
