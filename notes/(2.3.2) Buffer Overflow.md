# 2.3.2 Buffer Overflow

### Buffer Overflows
------
`What is a buffer overflow?`
- Attacker can write more than expected into an area of memory
- Additional memory **overflows** into another area

`How is this mitigated?`
- Developers must perform bounds checking
- Check that any write is writing within bounds

`Not a simple Exploit`
- Takes time to avoid crashing things
- Takes time to make it do what you want
- Right place, right time, perform a function

`What do attackers look for?`
- Look for an overflow that is easily `repeatable`
- Allows the attacker to perform advantageous functions

`Example: Elevated Rights`
- A contains 8 bits (null)
- B contains int 1979 (Anything under 2000 means user permissions)
- Overflow A (last byte into variable B)
- User now has elevated permissions (int B is above 2000)
