# 1.2.2 Non-Repudiation

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the concept of non-repudiation in cybersecurity
- Explain how digital signatures provide non-repudiation
- Distinguish between proof of integrity and proof of origin

## Overview
Non-repudiation ensures that a party cannot deny having performed a particular action or transaction. It provides cryptographic proof that a message was sent by a specific sender and has not been altered, making it impossible for the sender to later deny sending the message.

## Definition
**"You can't deny what you've said"** - There's no taking it back

**Example:** Signing a contract
- Your signature adds Non-repudiation
- You really signed the contract
- Others can see your signature

Non-repudiation adds a different perspective for cryptography:
- Proof of Integrity
- Proof of origin, high assurance of authenticity

## Proof of Integrity
- Verify data does not change
- The data remains accurate and consistent

**Cryptography: Use a HASH to provide Proof of Integrity**
- Represent data as a short string of text
- If the data changes, the hash changes
- **DOES NOT** associate data with a particular individual

## Proof of Origin (Authentication)
- Prove the message does not change → Integrity
- **Prove the source of the message** → Authentication
- Ensure the signature isn't fake
- **Non-Repudiation**

**Cryptography: Digital Signatures**
- Private key to sign with
- Message doesn't need to be encrypted
- No one else has this key
- Verify with the Public Key
- Any change of the message will invalidate the message
