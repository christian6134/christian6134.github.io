### "You can't deny what you've said"
- Theres no taking it back

**Example**
Signing a contract
- Your signature adds Non-repudiation
- You really signed the contract
- Others can see your signature

~ Adds a different perspective for cryptography
- Proof of Integrity
- Proof of origin, high assurance of authenticity

------

### Proof Of Integrity
---
- Verify data does not change
	- The data remains accurate and consistent

- Cryptography: **Use a HASH** to provide Proof of Integrity
	- Represent data as a short string of text
	- If the data changes, the hash changes
	- **DOES NOT** associate data with a particular individual




### Proof of Origin (Authentication)
----
- Prove the message does not change -> Integrity
- **Prove the source of the message** -> Authentication

~ Ensure the signature isn't fake
- `Non-Repudiation`

- Cryptography: **Digital Signatures**
	- Private key to sign with
	- Message doesn't need to be encrypted
	- No one else has this key
- Verify with the Public Key
- Any change of the message will invalidate the message
