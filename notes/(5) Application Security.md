## Overview
Application security involves balancing quality and security through comprehensive testing, input validation, secure coding practices, and continuous monitoring to protect applications from various vulnerabilities and attacks.

## Application Security Fundamentals

### Quality vs Security Balance
**Core Principle:** Balance between Quality and Security

**Key Requirements:**
- **Comprehensive Testing** - Testing, testing, testing
- **Vulnerability Discovery** - Vulnerabilities will be found
- **Continuous Improvement** - Ongoing security improvements
- **Risk Management** - Manage security risks effectively

**Security Considerations:**
- **Development Lifecycle** - Integrate security throughout development
- **Code Quality** - Maintain high code quality standards
- **Security Testing** - Implement security testing procedures
- **Documentation** - Document security requirements and implementations

## Input Validation

### Standard Input Validation
**Purpose:** Prevent malicious input from compromising applications

**SQL Injection Prevention:**
- **Parameterized Queries** - Use parameterized queries instead of string concatenation
- **Input Sanitization** - Sanitize all user inputs
- **Validation Rules** - Implement strict validation rules
- **Error Handling** - Proper error handling without information disclosure

**Validation Techniques:**
- **Data Type Validation** - Validate data types
- **Length Validation** - Validate input length
- **Format Validation** - Validate input format
- **Range Validation** - Validate input ranges

**Security Benefits:**
- **Attack Prevention** - Prevent various injection attacks
- **Data Integrity** - Ensure data integrity
- **System Stability** - Maintain system stability
- **User Experience** - Provide better user experience

## Secure Cookies

### Cookie Security
**Core Principle:** Do not store sensitive information within cookies

**Security Requirements:**
- **HTTPS Transport** - Secure cookies require HTTPS for transport
- **Data Limitation** - Cookies are data files, not executables
- **Sensitive Data** - Never store sensitive data in cookies
- **Encryption** - Encrypt sensitive cookie data when necessary

**Cookie Security Features:**
- **Secure Flag** - Use secure flag for HTTPS-only cookies
- **HttpOnly Flag** - Use HttpOnly flag to prevent JavaScript access
- **SameSite Attribute** - Use SameSite attribute for CSRF protection
- **Expiration** - Set appropriate expiration times

**Best Practices:**
- **Minimal Data** - Store minimal necessary data
- **Session Management** - Use cookies for session management only
- **Regular Cleanup** - Regularly clean up expired cookies
- **Monitoring** - Monitor cookie usage and security

## Static Code Analysis

### SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
**Definition:** Run code analysis using Static Application Security Testing

**Process:**
- **Code Review** - Review logs and make best decisions
- **Automated Analysis** - Automated code analysis
- **Vulnerability Detection** - Detect potential vulnerabilities
- **Report Generation** - Generate detailed reports

**Limitations:**
- **False Positives** - Not always correct (False Positives)
- **Incomplete Coverage** - Cannot find everything (Cryptographic implementations)
- **Context Missing** - May miss context-specific issues
- **Manual Review** - Requires manual review and validation

**Benefits:**
- **Early Detection** - Detect issues early in development
- **Automated Process** - Automated analysis process
- **Comprehensive Coverage** - Analyze entire codebase
- **Standards Compliance** - Help ensure coding standards compliance

## Code Signing

### Code Integrity Verification
**Question:** "Has the code changed since it left me?"

**Purpose:** Utilize code signing to verify integrity of code to developer

**Implementation:**
- **Digital Signatures** - Use digital signatures on code
- **Integrity Verification** - Verify code integrity
- **Certificate Authority** - Use in combination with Certificate Authority
- **Trust Establishment** - Establish trust in code authenticity

**Code Signing Process:**
- **Hash Generation** - Generate hash of code
- **Private Key Signing** - Sign hash with private key
- **Certificate Validation** - Validate certificate authority
- **Public Key Verification** - Verify with public key

**Benefits:**
- **Integrity Assurance** - Ensure code hasn't been modified
- **Authenticity** - Verify code comes from trusted source
- **Malware Prevention** - Prevent malicious code execution
- **User Trust** - Build user trust in applications

## Sandboxing

### Application Isolation
**Definition:** Applications cannot access unrelated resources

**Common Uses:**
- **Development** - Commonly used during development
- **Various Deployments** - Used in various deployment scenarios
- **Security Isolation** - Isolate applications for security

**Sandboxing Environments:**
- **Virtual Machines** - Isolate applications in VMs
- **Mobile Devices** - Sandbox mobile applications
- **Browsers** - Sandbox web applications
- **Containers** - Use containers for application isolation

**Benefits:**
- **Security Isolation** - Prevent unauthorized resource access
- **System Protection** - Protect system from malicious applications
- **Development Safety** - Safe development environment
- **Testing** - Isolated testing environments

## Monitoring

### Real-Time Information
**Application Usage:** Real-time information about application usage and demographics

**Security Monitoring:**
- **Blocked Attacks** - View blocked attacks
- **SQL Injections** - Monitor SQL injection attempts
- **Patched Vulnerabilities** - Track patched vulnerabilities
- **Threat Detection** - Detect security threats

**Audit Logs:**
- **Access Logs** - Log user access and activities
- **Security Events** - Log security-related events
