*What is the supply chain process?*
- Contains many parts
- Raw materials, suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, customers, consumers

*Why is this vulnerable?*
- Attackers can infect any step along the way
- Infect without suspicion
- People `trust the suppliers`
- Any exploit can infect the `entire chain` (HUGE RISK)


#### Service Providers
------
- Outsourcing a process / service to a 3rd party service provider
- Service provider is responsible for security concerns for this process
- Access to sensitive system / data
- An attacker attacks the service provider --> Data is at risk

*Fix?*
- Contract an ongoing security audit for all providers



#### Hardware Providers
----
Can you trust a new router/server/switch/firewall/software?

*How can we verify the new system*?
- Use a small supplier base
- Tighter control of vendors (trusted)
- Strict controls over policies and procedures 
	- Best practices for security


#### Software Providers
-----
Do I really trust this update / installation?

**Trust** is at the foundation of security
- Initial installation
	- Verify the digital signature prior to installation
- Updates and patches
	- How secure are the automatic updates?
