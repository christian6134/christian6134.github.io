#### Keyloggers
----
Keystrokes contain valuable information
- Web site logins URLs, passwords, email messages
- Saves all of your input 
- Occasionally sent to the attackers
- Circumvents `encryption protections`
	- Keystrokes are `in the clear`

Other data logging (screen logging, clipboard logging)



#### Logic bomb
-----
Waits for a `predefined event` to occur.
- Once the event occurs, the bomb is detonated
- Time / Date bombs
- User event triggered
- Difficult to recover once it detonates
- Does not have a anti-virus signature

Logic bombs are `difficult to recognize`
- Each is unique
- No `predefined signatures`

*Preventing a logic bomb*
- Processes and procedures that limit the change of any core operating system files
- Electronic Monitoring
- Constant Auditing



#### RootKits
-----
Originally a Unix technique.
- Modifies core system files
- Hides within the `kernel`
- Part of the Operating System itself
- Won't see it in Task Manager

Effectively invisible to traditional anti-virus softwares

*Removing RootKits*
- Possible to identify it with anti-malware scans
- Use a remover specific to the rootkit
- `Secure Boot with UEFI` looks for an OS signature and confirms nothing has changed with the kernel OS before the OS starts
