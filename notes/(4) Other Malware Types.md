# 2.4.4 Other Malware Types

## Learning Objectives
- Understand keyloggers and their threat to encryption
- Explain logic bombs and their detection challenges
- Describe rootkits and their stealth capabilities

## Overview
Advanced malware types include keyloggers, logic bombs, and rootkits that pose unique detection and removal challenges.

## Keyloggers
**Function:** Capture and record keystrokes to steal sensitive information

**Threats:**
- Capture website URLs, usernames, and passwords
- Steal email messages and personal communications
- Circumvent encryption protections (keystrokes are in plaintext)
- Monitor all user input including sensitive data

**Additional Capabilities:**
- Screen logging (capture screenshots)
- Clipboard logging (capture copied data)
- Network traffic monitoring

**Protection:**
- Virtual keyboards for sensitive input
- Two-factor authentication
- Regular malware scans
- Network monitoring for data exfiltration

## Logic Bombs
**Definition:** Malicious code triggered by specific predefined events

**Trigger Types:**
- **Time/Date Bombs** - Activated at specific times
- **User Event Triggers** - Activated by user actions
- **System Event Triggers** - Activated by system changes

**Characteristics:**
- Difficult to detect before activation
- No predefined antivirus signatures
- Each logic bomb is unique
- Causes significant damage once triggered

**Prevention:**
- Implement change control procedures
- Electronic monitoring of system files
- Regular auditing of system modifications
- Restrict access to core operating system files

## Rootkits
**Definition:** Malware that modifies core system files to hide its presence

**Characteristics:**
- Originally a Unix technique
- Modifies kernel-level system files
- Hides within the operating system kernel
- Invisible to traditional antivirus software
- Won't appear in Task Manager or process lists

**Detection and Removal:**
- Specialized anti-malware scans
- Rootkit-specific removal tools
- Secure Boot with UEFI verification
- OS signature validation before startup
- Complete system reinstallation if necessary

**Protection:**
- Enable Secure Boot
- Regular integrity checks of system files
- Monitor for unusual system behavior
- Implement kernel-level protection mechanisms
