**PROTECT data** on storage devices
- SSD, Hard Drive, USB Drive, Cloud Storage
- Data at rest

Full-disk and partition/volume encryption
- BitLocker, FileVault

Single File Encryption
- EFS (Encrypting File System) third-party utilities
- Built into NTFS (New Technology File System)
- Properties -> Encrypt Contents to enable EFS



### Database Encryption
----
**Protecting stored data**
- As well as transmission of data

**Transparent Encryption** (Entire Database)
- Encrypt all database information with a symmetric key
- Encrypt/Decrypt every time you pull from the Database

**Record Level Encryption**
- Encrypt individual columns
- Use separate symmetric keys for each column 
- Info that is not sensitive and private can be available in plaintext




### Transport Encryption
----
"**Protect data traversing the network**"
- Everything sent is protected and unreadable

Example:
- Encrypting in the application
	- Browsers can use HTTPs

- VPN (Virtual Private Network)
	- Connect various Sites
	- Need remote access
	- Encrypts all data transmitted over the network regardless of application
	- **Client Based VPN using SSL/TLS**
	- **Site to Site VPN using IPsec**



### Encryption Algorithms
-----
 "**There are many ways to encrypt data**"
- The proper formula must be used during encryption and decryption

**Both sides decide on the algorithm before encrypting the data**
- Details are hidden from the end user

**Advantages and Disadvantages between various algorithms**
- Security level, speed, complexity of implementation





### Cryptographic Keys
----------
There's very little unknown about a cryptographic process
- The algorithm is a known entity 
- The only thing you don't know is the **key**
- Can't reverse engineer anything

Memory Hook: We know how a locked door works, however we need the proper key. 

**Key Determines the output**
- Encrypted Data
- Hash Value
- Digital Signature 


#### Key Lengths
----
- **Larger keys tend to be more secure**
	- Prevent brute-force attacks
	- Attackers can try every combination
- **Symmetric Encryption**
	- 128 bit or larger key size
	- Key sizes can increase in the future
- **Asymmetric Encryption**
	- Complex calculations of prime numbers
	- Larger keys than symmetric encryption
	- Key lengths of 3,072 bits or larger



### Key Stretching
----------------
"Make our existing key more secure"

- Make a weak key stronger by performing multiple processes
	- Hash a password, Hash the Hash, Hash the Hash of the Hash
	- Key stretching / strengthening

- Brute force approaches would require decrypting multiple times
