What is BlockChain Tech?
- A distributed ledger
- Keep track of individual transactions


### What is Blockchain?

A **blockchain** is like a **tamper-resistant digital notebook** thatâ€™s shared and copied to **every computer** in a network. Itâ€™s called a **distributed ledger**, and itâ€™s used to keep track of things like money transfers, votes, or ownership records â€” **without needing a central authority**.

> ðŸ§  **Memory Hook:**  
> Imagine a classroom where every student keeps a copy of the gradebook. If someone tries to sneak in a higher grade, theyâ€™d be caught because their gradebook wouldn't match everyone elseâ€™s.  
> Thatâ€™s blockchain â€” everyone has a copy of the truth.

Everyone on the blockchain network maintains the ledger
- Records and replicates to anyone and everyone

Many practical applications
- Payment processing
- Digital identification
- Digital Voting


### Blockchain Process
----
Examples:
- Transferring BTC
- Transferring House Titles

1. Transaction is sent to every computer or node in a decentralized network to be verified
2. Verified transaction is added to a `new block of data` to be processed into the blockchain (with other recently verified transactions)
3. Add a secure code (hash) calculated from previous transaction data blocks. Hash is added to the new block of verified transactions
4. Block is added to the end of blockchain, added to everyones ledger

If any blocks are altered, its hash and all following hashes in the chain are automatically **recalculated**
- Altered chain will no longer match the chains stored by the rest of the network and **will be rejected**


#### Why the Hash Matters
-----
- If even **1 character** in a block is changed, the hash changes completely.
- This breaks the chain, so any tampering is **immediately obvious** and the network rejects it.
> ðŸ§  **Memory Hook:**  
> Think of the hash like a **tamper-evident seal**. If the sealâ€™s broken, everyone knows itâ€™s been messed with.


## Why Is Blockchain Powerful? 
---
- **Tamper-resistant**: You can't change past transactions without changing every copy on the network (which is practically impossible).
- **Decentralized**: No single person or company owns the data â€” itâ€™s spread out.
- **Trustless**: You donâ€™t have to trust a middleman like a bank or notary.
