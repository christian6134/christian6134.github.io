# 1.2.6 Physical Security

## Learning Objectives
- Understand various physical security controls and their purposes
- Explain how different physical barriers protect assets
- Describe surveillance and monitoring systems
- Understand access control mechanisms

## Overview
Physical security involves protecting physical assets, facilities, and people from unauthorized access, theft, damage, and other physical threats. It includes barriers, surveillance systems, access controls, and monitoring technologies.

## Physical Barriers

### Bollards
- Prevents access
- Channel people through an access point
- People can pass, Cars cannot
- High security area
- Moats, Concrete Barriers

### Access Control Vestibule
- All doors normally unlocked
  - Opening one door causes other to lock
- All doors normally locked
  - Unlocking one door prevents other from being unlocked
- One at a time, controlled groups
  - Manage control of access through an area

### Fencing
- Build a perimeter
- Robust (Difficult to climb)
- Prevent climbing
  - High fence
  - Barbed Wire

## Surveillance Systems

### Video Surveillance
- CCTV (Closed circuit Television)
  - Replaces physical guards
  - Requires a person to watch
- Motion recognition (alarms)
- Object detection can identify a license plate or face

### Security Guards/Access Badge
- Physical protection at reception area
- Validates identification of existing employees
- Two person integrity / control
  - Minimize exposure to an attack
  - No single person has access to a physical asset
- Access Badge
  - Picture, Name, Details
  - Worn at all times
  - Electronically Logged

## Lighting and Sensors

### Lighting
- More light â†’ More security
  - Attackers avoid light
  - Easier to see when lit
  - Non-IR cameras can see better
- Important for facial recognition
- Avoid shadow and glare

### Infrared
- Do not need light to see what is happening
- Motion detectors

### Pressure Sensors
- Detects a change in force
- Floor and window sensors

### Microwave Sensors
- Detects movement across large areas

### Ultrasonic Sensors
- Sends ultrasonic signals, receive reflected sound waves
- Detect motion, collision detection
