## Password Age and Expiration

### Password Lifecycle Management
**System Memory:** System remembers password history

**Unique Passwords:** Requires unique passwords every time

**Password History Benefits:**
- **Reuse Prevention** - Prevent password reuse
- **Security Enhancement** - Enhance security through variety
- **Compliance** - Meet compliance requirements
- **Attack Mitigation** - Mitigate password attacks

**Expiration Policies:**
