# 4.6.2 Access Controls

## Learning Objectives
- Understand authorization concepts and access control enforcement
- Explain least privilege principle and access control models
- Describe MAC, DAC, RBAC, rule-based, and ABAC access controls
- Identify time-based restrictions and access control best practices

## Overview
Access controls provide comprehensive authorization mechanisms to enforce policies that allow or disallow access to data and resources, implementing various access control models to ensure proper security while maintaining operational efficiency.

## Authorization Fundamentals

### Core Authorization Concepts
**Definition:** Provide access to resources after authentication

**Policy Enforcement:** Enforce policies that allow/disallow access to data

**Access Scope:**
- **Individual Access** - Can be applied individually
- **Group Access** - Can be applied to groups
- **Resource-Based** - Based on specific resources
- **Role-Based** - Based on user roles

**Access Control Modes:** Users receive rights based on access control modes

## Least Privilege

### Security Principle
**Definition:** Rights and permissions are set to bare minimum

**Implementation:**
- **Limited User Accounts** - All user accounts are limited
- **No Administrative Privileges** - Don't allow users to run with administrative privileges
- **Minimal Access** - Provide only necessary access
- **Regular Review** - Regularly review and adjust permissions

**Benefits:**
- **Reduced Attack Surface** - Minimize potential attack vectors
- **Data Protection** - Protect sensitive data
- **Compliance** - Meet regulatory compliance
- **Risk Mitigation** - Reduce security risks

## Mandatory Access Control (MAC)

### System-Enforced Control
**Definition:** Operating system limits operations on objects

**MAC Characteristics:**
- **Object Labeling** - Every object gets a label
- **Predefined Rules** - Labeling uses predefined rules
- **System Control** - System controls access, not users
- **High Security** - High security environments

**MAC Implementation:**
- **Security Labels** - Assign security labels to objects
- **Access Rules** - Define access rules based on labels
- **System Enforcement** - System enforces access rules
- **Audit Trail** - Maintain audit trail

**MAC Benefits:**
- **Strong Security** - Strong security model
- **Consistent Enforcement** - Consistent access enforcement
- **Compliance** - Meet high-security compliance requirements
- **Centralized Control** - Centralized access control

## Discretionary Access Control (DAC)

### User-Controlled Access
**Definition:** Used in most operating systems

**DAC Characteristics:**
- **User Control** - You create the spreadsheet, you control access
- **Flexible Access** - Very flexible access control
- **User Management** - Users manage their own resources
- **Weak Security** - Relatively weak security model

**DAC Examples:**
- **File Permissions** - File and folder permissions
- **Share Permissions** - Network share permissions
- **Object Ownership** - Object ownership rights
- **Permission Inheritance** - Permission inheritance

**DAC Limitations:**
- **Security Weakness** - Weak security model
- **User Error** - Vulnerable to user errors
- **Inconsistent** - Inconsistent security implementation
- **Compliance Issues** - May not meet compliance requirements

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### Role-Based Security
**Definition:** Based on role in organization

**RBAC Implementation:**
- **Administrator Control** - Administrators provide access based on role
- **Role Definition** - Define roles based on job functions
- **Permission Assignment** - Assign permissions to roles
- **User Assignment** - Assign users to roles

**Common Roles:**
- **Manager** - Management-level access
- **Director** - Director-level access
- **Team Lead** - Team leadership access
- **Developer** - Development access

**RBAC Benefits:**
- **Simplified Management** - Simplified access management
- **Consistent Access** - Consistent access across roles
- **Scalability** - Scale to large organizations
- **Compliance** - Meet compliance requirements

## Rule-Based Access Control

### System-Enforced Rules
**Definition:** Generic term for following rules

**Rule Characteristics:**
- **System Enforcement** - Access determined through system-enforced rules
- **Administrator Control** - System admins, not users, control rules
- **Object Association** - Rule is associated with object
- **Automated Enforcement** - Automated rule enforcement

**Rule Examples:**
- **Time-Based Rules** - Access based on time
- **Location-Based Rules** - Access based on location
- **Device-Based Rules** - Access based on device type
- **Network-Based Rules** - Access based on network

## Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

### Next-Generation Authorization
**Definition:** Users can have complex relationships to applications and data

**ABAC Capabilities:**
- **Multiple Parameters** - ABAC can consider many parameters
- **Complex Relationships** - Handle complex user-resource relationships
- **Dynamic Access** - Dynamic access control
- **Context-Aware** - Context-aware access decisions

**ABAC Parameters:**
- **Resource Information** - Information about resources
- **IP Address** - User's IP address
- **Time of Day** - Time-based access control
- **User Attributes** - User characteristics and attributes
- **Environmental Context** - Environmental factors

**ABAC Benefits:**
- **Flexible Control** - Flexible access control
- **Context Awareness** - Context-aware decisions
- **Fine-Grained** - Fine-grained access control
- **Scalable** - Scalable to complex environments

## Time of Day Restrictions

### Temporal Access Control
**Implementation:** Almost all security devices include time of day option

**Restriction Types:**
- **Time-Based** - Restrict access during certain times
- **Day-Based** - Restrict access on certain days of week
- **Schedule-Based** - Restrict based on schedules
- **Holiday-Based** - Restrict during holidays

**Time Restriction Benefits:**
- **Security Enhancement** - Enhance security during off-hours
- **Compliance** - Meet regulatory requirements
- **Resource Protection** - Protect resources during vulnerable times
- **Audit Trail** - Maintain audit trail of access times

**Implementation Examples:**
- **Network Access** - Restrict network access by time
- **Application Access** - Restrict application access by time
- **Database Access** - Restrict database access by time
- **System Administration** - Restrict admin access by time

## Access Control Best Practices

### Implementation Guidelines
**Policy Development:**
- **Clear Policies** - Develop clear access control policies
- **Regular Review** - Regularly review access policies
- **Documentation** - Document all access policies
- **Training** - Train users on access policies

**Monitoring and Auditing:**
- **Access Monitoring** - Monitor access activities
