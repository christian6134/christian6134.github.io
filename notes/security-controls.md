# 1.1 Security Controls

## Learning Objectives
- Compare and contrast various types of security controls.

## Overview
Security controls are measures implemented to prevent security events, minimize their impact, and limit damage. They are categorized into Technical, Managerial, Operational, and Physical controls, and further classified by type: Preventive, Deterrent, Detective, Corrective, Compensating, and Directive.

## Control Categories

### Technical Controls
- Implemented using a type of technical system
- Operating system controls (allowing/disallowing functions)
- Firewalls, anti-virus

### Managerial Controls
- Administrative controls associated with security design and implementation
- Security policies, Standard Operating Procedures

### Operational Controls
- Controls implemented by people instead of systems
- Security Guards, Awareness Programs (Posters, Best practices of Security)

### Physical Controls
- Limits physical access
- Guard shack
- Fences / Locks / Barricades
- Badge Readers

## Control Types

### Preventive Control Types
- Blocks access to a resource
- "You shall not pass"

**Examples:**
- Firewall Rules
- Following Security Policies
- Guard Shack Checks Identification
- Door Locks

### Deterrent Control Types
- Discourages an intrusion attempt
- Does not directly prevent access
- "Think Twice"

**Examples:**
- Application Splash Screens
- Threat of Demotion
- Front Reception Desk
- Warning Signs

### Detective Control Types
- Identify and log an intrusion attempt
- May not prevent access
- "Find the Issue"

**Examples:**
- Collecting reviewing system logs
- Review Log-In Reports
- Regular Patrol of Property
- Motion Detectors

### Corrective Security Control
- Occurs **after** the event has been detected
- May reverse impact of event
- Continue operating with minimal downtime
- "Correct the Problem"

**Examples:**
- Restoring from backups to mitigate ransomware infection
- Create policies for reporting security issues
- Contact law enforcement to manage criminal activity
- Fire extinguisher

### Compensating Control Types
- Control using other means
- Existing controls (other means) aren't sufficient
- Temporary Basis
- "Prevent the exploitation of a weakness"

**Examples:**
- Firewall blocks a specific application instead of patching the app
- Separation of duties, limit the scope of security concerns
- Multiple security guards working at the same time (No complete access)
- Backup Generator

### Directive Control Types
- Direct a subject towards security compliance
- Relatively weak security control
- "Do this please"

**Examples:**
- Store all sensitive files in a protected folder
- Create compliance policies and procedures
- Train users on proper security policy
- Post a sign for "Authorized Personnel Only"

## Control Matrix

| Categories / Control Types | Preventive | Deterrent | Detective | Corrective | Compensating | Directive |
|---------------------------|------------|-----------|-----------|------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Technical** | Firewall Rules | Application Splash Screens | System Logs | Restoring from Backup | Block instead of patch | Store files in protected folder |
| **Managerial** | On-Boarding Policy | A Demotion | Review Login reports | Create policies for reporting security issues | Separation of Duties | Directing staff to comply with policies |
| **Operational** | Guard Shacks (IDs) | Reception Desk | Patrolling guard | Law Enforcement | Multiple Security Staff working at once | Train users on security policy |
| **Physical** | Door Locks | Warning Signs | Motion Detectors | Fire Extinguisher | Backup Power Generator | Sign: Authorized Personnel Only |
