# 4.1.1 Secure Baselines

## Learning Objectives
- Understand secure baseline concepts and implementation
- Explain baseline establishment from manufacturers and developers
- Describe baseline deployment and automation strategies
- Identify baseline maintenance and conflict resolution

## Overview
Secure baselines provide foundational security configurations that all application instances must follow, ensuring consistent security posture across environments through standardized settings, policies, and configurations.

## Secure Baseline Fundamentals

### Core Concepts
**Definition:** When an application is deployed, we must consider all security implications

**Key Requirements:**
- **Well-Defined Security** - Application environment security must be clearly defined
- **Consistent Implementation** - All application instances must follow the baseline
- **Comprehensive Coverage** - Include firewall settings, patch levels, OS file versions
- **Constant Updates** - May require ongoing updates and maintenance

**Baseline Components:**
- **Firewall Settings** - Network security configurations
- **Patch Levels** - Current security patch status
- **Operating System Versions** - OS file versions and configurations
- **Application Settings** - Application-specific security settings
- **Access Controls** - User and system access configurations

### Integrity Measurements
**Purpose:** Check for secure baseline compliance

**Implementation:**
- **Regular Performance** - Performed often to ensure compliance
- **Documented Baselines** - Check against well-documented baselines
- **Immediate Correction** - Failure requires immediate correction
- **Automated Monitoring** - Continuous monitoring and validation

**Benefits:**
- **Compliance Assurance** - Ensure systems meet security standards
- **Risk Mitigation** - Identify and correct security gaps
- **Consistency** - Maintain consistent security posture
- **Documentation** - Provide audit trail and compliance evidence

## Establish Baselines

### Foundational Security Policies
**Sources:** Often available from various manufacturers and developers

**Policy Sources:**
- **Application Developers** - Security recommendations from app developers
- **Operating System Manufacturers** - OS security guidelines
- **Appliance Manufacturers** - Hardware security configurations
- **Industry Standards** - CIS benchmarks and other standards

**Configuration Complexity:**
- **Extensive Options** - Many operating systems have extensive configuration options
- **Windows 10 Example** - Over 3,000 group policy settings available
- **Customization** - Baselines can be customized for specific needs
- **Documentation** - Comprehensive documentation and guidance

**Best Practices:**
- **Start with Standards** - Begin with established security standards
- **Customize Appropriately** - Modify baselines for organizational needs
- **Document Changes** - Document all customizations and rationale
- **Regular Reviews** - Review and update baselines regularly

## Deploy Baselines

### Implementation Strategy
**Question:** "How do we put those baselines into action?"

**Deployment Requirements:**
- **Multiple Mechanisms** - May require multiple deployment mechanisms
- **Automation** - Automation is key for large-scale deployment
- **Scalability** - Deploy to thousands of devices efficiently
- **Consistency** - Ensure consistent deployment across all systems

**Deployment Methods:**
- **Group Policy** - Windows domain-based deployment
- **Configuration Management** - Tools like Ansible, Puppet, Chef
- **Mobile Device Management** - MDM for mobile devices
- **Cloud Configuration** - Cloud-based configuration management

**Automation Benefits:**
- **Efficiency** - Rapid deployment to large numbers of devices
- **Consistency** - Identical configuration across all systems
- **Error Reduction** - Minimize human error in deployment
- **Scalability** - Easy to scale to additional systems

## Maintain Baselines

### Ongoing Maintenance
**Stability:** Many baselines rarely change

**Update Requirements:**
- **New Vulnerabilities** - Updates for newly discovered vulnerabilities
- **Updated Applications** - Updates for application changes
- **Updated Operating Systems** - Updates for OS changes
- **Security Patches** - Regular security patch updates

### Conflict Resolution
**Challenge:** Some baselines may contradict others

**Complexity Factors:**
- **Enterprise Environments** - Complex enterprise environments
- **Multiple Systems** - Various systems with different requirements
- **Conflicting Requirements** - Different security requirements
- **Integration Issues** - System integration challenges

**Resolution Strategies:**
- **Testing** - Test and measure to avoid conflicts
- **Documentation** - Document all baseline changes
- **Change Management** - Implement proper change management
- **Stakeholder Communication** - Communicate with all stakeholders

**Best Practices:**
- **Regular Testing** - Test baseline changes before deployment
- **Impact Assessment** - Assess impact of baseline changes
- **Rollback Plans** - Have rollback plans for failed deployments
- **Monitoring** - Monitor systems after baseline changes

## Baseline Management Tools

### Configuration Management
- **Ansible** - Automation and configuration management
- **Puppet** - Configuration management platform
- **Chef** - Infrastructure automation
- **Terraform** - Infrastructure as code

### Security Standards
- **CIS Benchmarks** - Center for Internet Security benchmarks
- **NIST Guidelines** - National Institute of Standards and Technology
