# 5.2.4 Business Impact Analysis

## Learning Objectives
- Understand recovery time objectives (RTO) and service level requirements
- Explain recovery point objectives (RPO) and data loss acceptability
- Describe mean time to repair (MTTR) and issue resolution metrics
- Identify mean time between failure (MTBF) and outage prediction

## Overview
Business Impact Analysis (BIA) defines recovery objectives and metrics to ensure business continuity, including recovery time objectives, recovery point objectives, mean time to repair, and mean time between failure to support effective disaster recovery and business continuity planning.

## Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

### Service Restoration
**Definition:** Get up and running quickly

**RTO Purpose:** Get back to particular service level

**RTO Requirements:**
- **Database Operational** - Database must be operational
- **Server Operational** - Server must be operational
- **Service Level** - Achieve required service level
- **Business Continuity** - Maintain business continuity

**RTO Benefits:**
- **Business Continuity** - Maintain business continuity
- **Service Level** - Meet service level requirements
- **Stakeholder Confidence** - Maintain stakeholder confidence
- **Competitive Advantage** - Maintain competitive advantage

**RTO Implementation:**
- **Recovery Procedures** - Define recovery procedures
- **Resource Allocation** - Allocate recovery resources
- **Testing** - Test recovery procedures
- **Monitoring** - Monitor recovery performance

## Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

### Data Loss Acceptability
**Definition:** How much loss is acceptable

**RPO Purpose:** How far back does the data go?

**RPO Example:** We need 12 months of data

**RPO Considerations:**
- **Data Criticality** - Consider data criticality
- **Business Requirements** - Consider business requirements
- **Compliance** - Consider compliance requirements
- **Cost-Benefit** - Consider cost-benefit analysis

**RPO Benefits:**
- **Data Protection** - Protect critical data
- **Business Continuity** - Support business continuity
- **Compliance** - Meet compliance requirements
- **Risk Mitigation** - Mitigate data loss risks

**RPO Implementation:**
- **Backup Strategy** - Define backup strategy
- **Data Classification** - Classify data by importance
- **Recovery Procedures** - Define recovery procedures
- **Testing** - Test recovery procedures

## Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)

### Issue Resolution Metrics
**Definition:** Average time to fix an issue

**MTTR Components:**
- **Diagnosis Time** - Includes diagnosis time
- **Repair Time** - Actual repair time
- **Testing Time** - Testing and verification time
- **Documentation Time** - Documentation time

**MTTR Purpose:** Metric for determining cost and time associated with outages

**MTTR Benefits:**
- **Performance Measurement** - Measure repair performance
- **Resource Planning** - Plan repair resources
- **Process Improvement** - Improve repair processes
- **Cost Analysis** - Analyze repair costs

**MTTR Improvement:**
- **Process Optimization** - Optimize repair processes
- **Training** - Train repair personnel
- **Tool Enhancement** - Enhance repair tools
- **Documentation** - Improve documentation

## Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF)

### Outage Prediction
**Definition:** Time between outages

**MTBF Purpose:** Used as a prediction

**MTBF Calculation:** Total uptime / number of breakdowns

**MTBF Benefits:**
- **Reliability Prediction** - Predict system reliability
- **Maintenance Planning** - Plan maintenance activities
- **Resource Planning** - Plan for possible outages
- **Performance Measurement** - Measure system performance

**MTBF Applications:**
- **Preventive Maintenance** - Schedule preventive maintenance
- **Capacity Planning** - Plan system capacity
- **Risk Assessment** - Assess system risks
- **Service Level** - Define service levels
