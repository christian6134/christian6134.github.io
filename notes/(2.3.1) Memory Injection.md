# 2.3.1 Memory Injection

### Finding Malware
-----
- Malware runs in **memory**
	- Malware has to exist in memory

- Memory contains running **processes**
	- Dynamic Link libraries
	- Threads
	- Buffers
	- Memory Management Function
	- Much More

**Where does the malware hide?**:
- Hidden somewhere within memory
Choices:
- Runs in its `own process`
- **Injects** itself into a `legitimate process`


### Memory Injection
-----
**What is memory injection?**
- When code is **added** to an **existing** process
- Hide the malware inside the process
- Inject between 2 addresses (Starting and Ending)

**Why is this dangerous?**
- The malware gains access to the data in that process
- Upgrades to the same rights and permissions
- `Privilege Escalation`

#### DLL Injection
------
`One of the most common forms of malware injections.`
- Dynamic-Link Library
- Windows library containing code and data
- Used by `many applications`

**How does this work**?
- Attackers inject a **path** to a malicious DLL
- Runs as part of the target process
- Process reaches a point where it **reaches** that **reference**
- Goes to disk and **retrieves** the **DLL** (malware from memory) and is now running on the system
