### Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
--------
"**Provides Encryption Functions for a Single Device**"
Exists on a Motherboard
- Specifically designed to provide **cryptographic functions**
- Cryptographic processes
	- Random number generator, key generators

- **Persistent Memory**
	- Unique keys burned in during manufacturing

- **Versatile Memory**
	- Storage keys, hardware configuration information securely store "BitLocker Keys"

- Password protected
	- No way to use a dictionary attack



### Hardware Security Module (HSM)
------
`What if we need to provide cryptographic functions to thousands of devices?`

- **Used in Large Environments**
	- Clusters, redundant power
	- Securely store thousands of cryptographic keys

- High-end Cryptographic hardware (separate hardware to perform fast crypto functions)
	- Plug in card / separate hardware device

- Key Backup
	- Secure storage in hardware
	- Prevents unauthorized access

- Cryptographic Accelerators
	- Offload the CPU overhead from other devices


### Key Management System
---------------
- Services are everywhere
	- How can we manage these keys
	- On-premise, cloud based
	- Many keys for many services

- Manage all keys from a **centralized manager**
	- Provided as third-party software
	- Separate encryption keys from the data
	- Create keys for specific services or cloud provider (SSL/TLS)
	- Associate keys with end-users
	- "Rotate" keys on regular intervals
	- **Log** key use and events


### Keeping Data Private
-----
- Data can be located in various places
	- Mobile phones, cloud, laptops, etc
	- Most private data is often **closest** to us
	- Attackers are always finding new techniques
	- Data is constantly changing



### Secure Enclave
------
- A protected area for our secretes
	- Implemented as a hardware processor
	- Isolated from Main CPU
	- Many different forms

- Fingerprints, FaceID
- Encrypted Apple Pay transactions
- Secure boot verification
- Private keys & secrets

- Provides extensive security features
	- Has its own BOOT ROM
	- Monitors system boot process
	- True random number generator
	- Real-time Memory Encryption
	- Root Cryptographic Keys 
	- Performs AES encryption in hardware

**Memory Hook:** A Safe within your CPU
