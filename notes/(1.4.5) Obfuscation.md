### What is Obfuscation?
-------
- The process of making something unclear
	- It's now much more difficult to understand now

- Not impossible to understand
	- If you know hot to read it

- "Hide information in plain sight"
	- Ex: Storing payment information without storing a credit card number

- **Type of Obfuscation**
	- **Steganography**
		- Hiding information inside of an image


### Steganography (Image)
-----
- Greek for `concealed writing`
	- Security `through obscurity` - "Hide the Key not the Lock"
	- "Security through obscurity is not really security at all"
- If you manage to figure out how the data is hidden, you can figure out how to recover the information

- Covertext
	- The container document or file


#### Common steganography techniques
---
- **Network Based**
	- Embed messages in TCP packets
	- Sent a few bits or bytes at a time

- **Use an Image**
	- Embed the message in the image itself

- **Invisible Watermarks**
	- Yellow dots on printers

- **Audio Steganography**
	- Modify the digital audio file
	- Interlace a secret message

- **Video Steganography**
	- Sequence of images
	- Great deal of secret information
	- Manage the signal to noise ratio



### Tokenization: Form of Obfuscation
----
- Replace sensitive data with a `non-sensitive placeholder`
	- Example: Changing a SSN to a random number
	- Transfer the modified number across the network
	- "A disguise until we are safe"

- Common in Credit Card processing
	- Apple Pay uses a temporary taken during payment
	- Created from Credit Card Number
	- One time use token
	- Useful if captured

- **Does not use encryption or hashing**
	- Original data and token aren't mathematically related

### Data Masking
-----
**Data Obfuscation**
- Hide some of the original data
- `**** **** **** 9989`

**Protects PII**
- And other sensitive data

**May only be hidden from view**
- Data may be intact in storage
- Control the `view based on permissions`

**Techniques:**
- Substituting, shuffling, encrypting, masking out.
