# 2.4.1 Malware Overview

## Learning Objectives
- Understand what malware is and its various types
- Identify common malware delivery methods
- Explain ransomware attacks and protection strategies

## Overview
Malware is any software designed to perform malicious actions on a system. It can gather information, steal data, encrypt files, or provide unauthorized access to attackers.

## What is Malware?
Malware is any type of software that performs malicious actions on your system:
- Gathers information and keystrokes
- Displays unwanted advertising
- Encrypts your data (ransomware)
- Provides unauthorized access to attackers

## Malware Types
- **Viruses** - Self-replicating code that attaches to files
- **Worms** - Self-propagating malware that spreads via networks
- **Ransomware** - Encrypts data and demands payment for decryption
- **Trojan Horses** - Disguised malicious software
- **Spyware** - Monitors user activity and steals information
- **RootKit** - Provides persistent access while hiding its presence
- **Keylogger** - Records keystrokes to steal credentials
- **Bloatware** - Unwanted software that consumes resources
- **Logic Bomb** - Malicious code triggered by specific conditions

## Malware Delivery Methods
Malware requires execution to function and uses various methods to run:
- **Drive-by downloads** - Automatic downloads from malicious websites
- **Web page pop-ups** - Social engineering to trick users
- **Worms** - Exploit vulnerabilities to self-propagate
- **Email attachments** - Malicious files disguised as legitimate documents
- **Removable media** - USB drives and other external storage

## Targets of Malware
- Personal data and credentials
- Important documents and files
- Organizational data and intellectual property
- System resources and computing power

## Ransomware
Ransomware takes over a machine, encrypts data, and demands payment for the decryption key:
- Operating system remains functional
- Data becomes inaccessible without the decryption key
- Attackers demand payment (usually cryptocurrency)
- Uses public-key cryptography maliciously

**Protection Strategies:**
- Store backups offline and test restoration procedures
- Keep operating systems and applications updated
- Maintain current anti-virus/anti-malware signatures
- Implement email filtering and web content filtering
- Train users to recognize phishing attempts
