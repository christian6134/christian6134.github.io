# 3.1.2 Network Infrastructure Concepts

## Learning Objectives
- Understand physical isolation and network segmentation
- Explain network security controls and monitoring
- Describe network architecture security principles

## Overview
Network infrastructure security involves implementing physical isolation, logical segmentation, and comprehensive monitoring to protect network resources and data flows.

## Physical Isolation

### Network Segmentation
**Purpose:** Divide network into smaller, controlled segments

**Benefits:**
- Limit attack scope
- Improve performance
- Simplify management
- Enhance security

**Implementation Methods:**
- VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks)
- Subnets
- Firewall rules
- Access control lists

### Physical Security Controls
- **Data Centers** - Secure facilities with controlled access
- **Network Equipment** - Locked cabinets and rooms
- **Cable Management** - Protected and organized cabling
- **Environmental Controls** - Temperature, humidity, power

## Network Security Architecture

### Perimeter Security
- **Firewalls** - Control traffic flow
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** - Monitor for threats
- **Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)** - Block threats
- **Demilitarized Zones (DMZ)** - Buffer between networks

### Internal Security
- **Network Access Control (NAC)** - Device authentication
- **Endpoint Security** - Host-based protection
- **Network Monitoring** - Traffic analysis
- **Segmentation** - Isolate critical systems

### Wireless Security
- **WPA3 Encryption** - Latest wireless security standard
- **Network Authentication** - 802.1X
- **Guest Networks** - Isolated access
- **Rogue AP Detection** - Identify unauthorized access points

## Network Monitoring and Management

### Traffic Analysis
- **Flow Analysis** - Monitor data flows
- **Packet Inspection** - Deep packet analysis
- **Anomaly Detection** - Identify unusual patterns
- **Performance Monitoring** - Track network health

### Security Monitoring
- **SIEM Integration** - Centralized logging
- **Threat Intelligence** - External threat feeds
- **Incident Response** - Automated responses
- **Forensic Analysis** - Post-incident investigation

## Network Protocols and Security

### Secure Protocols
- **HTTPS** - Encrypted web traffic
- **SSH** - Secure shell access
- **SFTP** - Secure file transfer
- **VPN** - Virtual private networks

### Protocol Security
- **DNS Security** - DNSSEC implementation
- **Email Security** - SPF, DKIM, DMARC
- **Network Time Protocol** - NTP security
- **Routing Security** - BGP security

## Best Practices
- Implement defense in depth
- Regular security assessments
- Continuous monitoring
- Patch management
- Access control
