# 1.4.1 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

**Policies, procedures, hardware, software, people**
- Digital certificates: 
	- Create
	- Distribute
	- Manage
	- Store 
	- Revoke
- Lots of planning

Refers to the binding of public keys to people or devices
- Certificate Authority
- How can we trust?




### Symmetric Encryption
----
**A single, shared key**
- Encrypt with Key(1)
- Decrypt with Key(1)
- If it gets out, you'll need another key

"Secret Key Algorithm"

Keys must be shared, this is not scalable for more than 10 people. 

**Benefits**:
- Very fast
- Less overhead than asymmetric
- Often combined with asymmetric encryption



### Asymmetric Encryption
----
**Public key cryptography**
- Two+ mathematically related keys
- Created at the same time

**Private Key**
- Assign one to be private 
- Keep it private

**Public***
- Anyone can see this key
- Give it away

**Note**: The private key is the only key that can decrypt data encrypted with the public key. 
- You cannot derive the private key from the public key




### KEY Pair
-----
Asymmetric Encryption (Public Key Cryptography)

**Key Generation**
- Build both the public and private key at the same time
- Randomization
- Large prime numbers
- Lots of math

Example:
- Large Random Number ---> Key Generation Program --> Alice Public Key + alice Private key

Everyone can have the public key
- Only Alice has the private key




### Asymmetric Encryption Example (Key Pair)

### Key Escrow
-----
Someone else **holds** your decryption keys
- Private keys are in the hands of a 3rd Party
- May be within your own organization

Legitimate business arrangement
- Someway to decrypt data
- Government agencies may need to decrypt partner data
- Controversial, yet required.
