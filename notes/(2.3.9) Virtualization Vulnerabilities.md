#### Virtualization Security
-----
- Different from non-virtual machines
	- Can appear Anywhere
- Quantity of resources vary between VMs (CPU, memory, Storage)
- Many similarities to physical machines
	- Complexity adds opportunity for the attackers

Some security vulnerabilities
- Local privilege escalations
- Command Injection
- Information Disclosure


#### VM Escape Protection
-------
A virtual machine is self-contained.

**Virtual Machine Escape** (within the same Hypervisor)
- Break out of the VM and interact with the host OS or hardware
- Once you escape the VM, you have great control
- **Huge exploit** -> Simultaneous systems


#### Resource Re-use
--------
Note: The hypervisor manages the `relationship between physical and virtual resources.`

- `What type of resources?` - Available RAM, storage space, CPU availability

Resources can be reused between VMs
- Hypervisor host can host with 4GB of physical RAM
- Supports three VMs with 2GB of RAM each
- RAM is allocated and shared between VMs

`What does shared resources mean for a VM?`
- Data can be inadvertently shared between VMs
