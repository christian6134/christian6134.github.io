# 2.3.95 Zero Day Vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerabilities
-----
Many applications have vulnerabilities
- Not discovered `yet`

Yet-to-be discovered holes are found by attackers themselves


#### Zero-Day
-----
Attackers search for unknown vulnerabilities
- Create exploits against the vulnerabilities

Vendor has no idea the vulnerability exists
- No fix formulated
- No patches

Difficult to defend against the unknown.
