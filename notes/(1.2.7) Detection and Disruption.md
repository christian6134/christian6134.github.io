# 1.2.7 Detection and Disruption

## Learning Objectives
- Understand honeypot technologies and their purposes
- Explain different types of honeypot systems
- Describe how honeytokens work for tracking
- Understand deception technologies in cybersecurity

## Overview
Detection and disruption technologies use deception to identify, track, and disrupt malicious activities. These systems create fake environments and data to attract attackers and gather intelligence about their methods and intentions.

## Honeypot Technologies

### Honeypots
**Create a virtual world to explore**
- Mock, not a real part of the important process
- Attract the bad guys
  - Keep them here
- The "attacker" is an automated process
  - Recon
  - What systems are they attacking
- Constant battle to discern the real from the fake

### Honeynets
- Simulate real networks including more than a single device
  - Servers, workstations, routers, switches, firewalls
- Combine Honeypots into Honeynets
  - Larger deception network
  - Believable infrastructure

### Honeyfiles
- Attract the attackers with more honey
  - Fake files, fake information
  - Something bright and shiny
- Honeyfiles
  - Bait for the honeynet (passwords.txt)
  - Add money honeyfiles to file shares
- An alert is sent if the **file is accessed**
  - Virtual bear trap

### Honeytokens
- Track the malicious actors
  - Add traceable data to the honeynet
  - If data is stolen, you'll know where it came from

**Types of Honeytokens:**
- **API Credentials**
  - Does not provide actual access
  - Notifications are sent when used
- **Fake Email Addresses**
  - Add it to a contact list
  - Monitor the internet to see who posts it
- Database records, browser cookies, web page pixels
