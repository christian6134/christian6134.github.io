# 5.2.2 Risk Analysis

## Learning Objectives
- Understand qualitative and quantitative risk assessment methods
- Explain quantitative risk metrics including ARO, AV, EF, SLE, and ALE
- Describe impact categories and likelihood vs probability measurements
- Identify risk appetite, tolerance, and risk register management

## Overview
Risk analysis involves both qualitative and quantitative assessment methods to evaluate risk factors, calculate potential losses, assess impact categories, and establish risk appetite and tolerance levels through comprehensive risk register management.

## Qualitative Risk Assessment

### Risk Factor Identification
**Purpose:** Identify significant risk factors

**Assessment Method:** Display with a grid

**Qualitative Benefits:**
- **Risk Prioritization** - Prioritize risks effectively
- **Stakeholder Communication** - Communicate risks to stakeholders
- **Quick Assessment** - Quick risk assessment
- **Resource Allocation** - Allocate resources based on risk

**Grid Display:** Visual representation of risk factors

## Quantitative Risk Assessment

### Risk Metrics and Calculations
**Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO):** Frequency of risk occurrence per year

**Asset Value (AV):** Value of asset to organization

**AV Components:**
- **Asset Cost** - Cost of the asset
- **Sales Effect** - Effect on sales
- **Regulatory Fines** - Potential regulatory fines
- **Business Impact** - Business impact value

**Exposure Factor (EF):** Percentage of value lost due to incident

**EF Examples:**
- **Entire Asset** - Entire asset is 1.0
- **Quarter Loss** - Quarter is 0.25
- **Partial Loss** - Various partial loss percentages

**Single Loss Expectancy (SLE):** Monetary loss if single event occurs

**SLE Calculation:** Asset Value × Exposure Factor

**SLE Example:** Laptop stolen = $1,000 (AV) × 1.0 (EF) = $1,000 (SLE)

**Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE):** Expected annual loss

**ALE Calculation:** ARO × SLE

**ALE Example:** Seven laptops stolen per year (ARO) × $1,000 (SLE) = $7,000

**Business Impact:** Business impact is more than monetary

## Impact Categories

### Impact Assessment
**Life Impact:** Impact on human life

**Property Impact:** Impact on physical property

**Safety Impact:** Impact on safety

**Financial Impact:** Impact on finances

**Impact Assessment Benefits:**
- **Comprehensive Analysis** - Comprehensive impact analysis
- **Risk Prioritization** - Prioritize risks by impact
- **Resource Allocation** - Allocate resources appropriately
- **Decision Support** - Support decision making

## Likelihood and Probability

### Risk Measurement
**Risk Likelihood:** Qualitative measurement of risk

**Risk Probability:** Quantitative measurement of risk

**Probability Characteristics:**
- **Statistical Measurement** - Statistical measurement
- **Historical Performance** - Based on historical performance (sometimes)
- **Data-Driven** - Data-driven assessment
- **Predictive** - Predictive risk assessment

**Measurement Benefits:**
- **Risk Quantification** - Quantify risk levels
- **Comparison** - Compare different risks
- **Resource Planning** - Plan resources based on probability
- **Decision Making** - Support decision making

## Risk Appetite and Tolerance

### Risk Acceptance Levels
**Core Question:** How much risk can we take?

**Risk Appetite Posture:** Qualitative description

**Appetite Levels:**
- **Conservative** - Conservative risk appetite
- **Neutral** - Neutral risk appetite
- **Expansionary** - Expansionary risk appetite

**Risk Tolerance:** Acceptable variance

**Risk Appetite Analogy:** Highway speed limit (55 mph)

**Risk Tolerance Analogy:** Exceeding could be ticketed

**Tolerance Characteristics:**
- **Higher Tolerance** - Higher risk tolerance over appetite
- **Variable Tolerance** - Tolerance can change
- **Context Dependent** - Dependent on context
- **Management Decision** - Management decision

## Risk Register

### Risk Management Framework
**Definition:** Every risk detailed associated with project

**Register Components:**
- **Risk Monitoring** - Monitor results
- **Key Risk Indicators** - Identify risks impacting organization
- **Risk Owners** - Each indicator assigned someone to manage risk
- **Risk Threshold** - Cost of mitigation equals value gained

**Key Risk Indicators (KRIs):**
- **Risk Identification** - Identify risks impacting organization
- **Early Warning** - Provide early warning signals
- **Trend Analysis** - Analyze risk trends
- **Management Support** - Support risk management

**Risk Owners:**
- **Accountability** - Clear accountability for risks
- **Management Responsibility** - Management responsibility
- **Decision Authority** - Authority to make risk decisions
- **Reporting** - Report on risk status

**Risk Threshold:**
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis** - Cost of mitigation vs value gained
- **Decision Criteria** - Criteria for risk decisions
- **Resource Allocation** - Resource allocation decisions
- **Risk Acceptance** - Risk acceptance criteria

## Best Practices
- **Comprehensive Analysis** - Conduct comprehensive risk analysis
- **Regular Updates** - Update risk assessments regularly
- **Stakeholder Involvement** - Involve relevant stakeholders
- **Documentation** - Document all analysis activities
- **Risk Monitoring** - Monitor risks continuously
- **Decision Support** - Use analysis for decision support
- **Compliance** - Ensure regulatory compliance
- **Continuous Improvement** - Continuously improve analysis processes
