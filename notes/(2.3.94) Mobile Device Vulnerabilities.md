Mobile devices are `challenging to secure.`
- Often require `additional policies / procedures / technology` just to be able to provide security.
- Always in motion
- Relatively small
- `Packed` with sensitive data
- Constantly connected to the internet


#### Jailbreaking/rooting
-------
Gaining access
- Android - rooting
- Apple IOS - Jailbreaking

Implement your own `operating system`
- Install custom firmware
- Replaces the existing OS

Enable new features
- Circumvent security

Uncontrolled access


#### Sideloading
----
Users install applications `consisting of malicious code.`
- Trojan horse -> Data breach
- Circumvent security
- Apps can be installed manually without using an app store
- `Mobile Device Manager (MDM)` becomes useless

*How can we prevent Sideloading?*
- Manage installation sources
