# 3.2.1 Secure Infrastructures

## Learning Objectives
- Understand device placement strategies for network security
- Explain security zones and their implementation
- Describe attack surface reduction techniques
- Identify secure connectivity methods

## Overview
Secure infrastructure design involves strategic device placement, security zone implementation, attack surface minimization, and secure connectivity to create robust network defenses.

## Device Placement

### Strategic Positioning
**Purpose:** Every network is different, but there are common security principles for device placement.

**Firewall Placement:**
- **Network Segmentation** - Divide network into controlled segments
- **Trust Separation** - Separate trusted from untrusted networks
- **Security Checks** - Provide additional security validation points

**Additional Security Devices:**
- **Honeypots** - Deception systems to detect attackers
- **Jump Servers** - Secure access points to protected networks
- **Load Balancers** - Distribute traffic and provide redundancy
- **Sensors** - Monitor network activity and threats

## Security Zones

### Zone-Based Security
**Concept:** Zone-based security technologies provide more flexibility and security than IP address ranges.

**Zone Types:**
- **Trusted Zones** - Internal, secure networks
- **Untrusted Zones** - External, public networks
- **DMZ Zones** - Demilitarized zones for public-facing services
- **Screened Zones** - Isolated networks for specific purposes

**Benefits:**
- **Simplified Policies** - Easier security rule management
- **Scalability** - Maintainable on large rule bases
- **Flexibility** - Dynamic security policy application
- **Clarity** - Clear network boundaries and trust levels

## Attack Surface Reduction

### Minimizing Vulnerabilities
**Question:** "How many ways are there into your home?"

**Attack Surface Components:**
- **Application Code** - Software vulnerabilities
- **Open Ports** - Network service exposure
- **Authentication Processes** - Login mechanism weaknesses
- **Human Error** - Social engineering targets

**Reduction Strategies:**
- **Code Auditing** - Regular security code reviews
- **Port Management** - Block unnecessary ports on firewalls
- **Real-time Monitoring** - Continuous network traffic analysis
- **Access Controls** - Implement least privilege principles
- **Security Training** - Educate users on security best practices

## Secure Connectivity

### Multi-Layer Security
**Principle:** "Everything is connected, everything contributes to security"

### Physical Security
- **Secure Network Cabling** - Protect physically and logically
- **Cable Management** - Organized and protected infrastructure
- **Physical Access Controls** - Restrict access to network equipment

### Application-Level Encryption
- **Built-in Security** - Leverage existing application security features
- **End-to-End Encryption** - Protect data throughout its lifecycle
- **Secure Protocols** - Use HTTPS, SFTP, and other secure protocols

### Network-Level Encryption
- **IPsec Tunnels** - Secure site-to-site connections
- **VPN Connections** - Encrypted remote access
- **TLS/SSL** - Secure web and application communications
- **Wireless Security** - WPA3 and enterprise authentication

## Best Practices
- **Defense in Depth** - Multiple security layers
- **Regular Assessments** - Ongoing security evaluations
- **Continuous Monitoring** - Real-time threat detection
- **Incident Response** - Prepared response procedures
- **Staff Training** - Regular security education
- **Vendor Management** - Third-party security oversight
