1. **Authenticating** People
2. **Authenticating** Systems
3. **Authorization** Models
### AAA Framework
------
**Identification**
- Claim to be a particular user
- UsernameÍ
	
**Authentication**
- Proves we are who we claim
- "We knew the password" 
- Got authenticated

**Authorization**
- Based on identification / authentication, **what access do you have**?

**Accounting**
- Resources used?
- Login Time?
- Data send / received
- Logout Time


### Authenticating People
------
![[Authenticating People.png]]
(i) **Client** provides **Identification**

(ii) **AAA Server**: Retrieves request from Concentrator **(Authentication)**
- Does this info match the database?
- Sends "Credentials Approved" to concentrator

(iii) **Concentrator:** Allows access to the file server


### Authenticating Systems
------
You have to **manage devices** that you can't **physically see**.
Q: How can we verify that a system (computer) is authorized to use our network?
- Systems can't type passwords

**How can you truly authenticate a device?**
- Put a **digitally signed certificate** on the device.

**Other business** processes rely on the certificate
- Access VPN from authorized devices
- Management software can validate the end device



### Certificates
----
**Certificate Authentication**
- An organization must have a trusted **Certificate Authority (CA)**

**Certificates** are created for each device
- Signed by the Certificate Authority

**Use signed certificates** as an authentication factor
- Was it really signed by the (CA)?

-----


### Authorization Models
---
- User / Device is now authenticated
	- What do they have access to? (Resources)
	- Time to apply an **Authorization model**

- Users / Services -> Data and Applications
	- Associate individual users to **access rights** is not scalable

**Put an authorization model** in the middle (before accessing data / applications)
- Defined and filtered by *Roles, Organizations, Attributes*

**(i) No Authorization Model**
- User has rights to access -> Resources
- Does not scale (10,000) users means 10,000 different to be set for 10,000 resources

**(ii)** Authorization Model
- Add an abstraction
	- Reduce Complexity
	- Clear relationship between user / resource

- **Administration is streamlined**
	- Support large infrastructure

- **Create** role groups assigned with various resources
- New users? -> Instead of manually mapping users to resources we can add the users to the "group"
