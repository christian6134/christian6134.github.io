- **Storage Location** - Onsite vs offsite storage
- **Backup Software** - Backup and recovery software
- **Schedule** - Day of the week and timing

**Key Considerations:**
- **Data Volume** - Amount of data affects backup time and storage
- **Recovery Time** - Time required to restore data
- **Storage Costs** - Cost of backup storage media
- **Network Bandwidth** - Network capacity for remote backups
- **Security Requirements** - Encryption and access controls
- **Compliance** - Regulatory requirements for data retention

## Onsite vs Offsite Backups

### Onsite Backups
**Characteristics:**
- **No Internet Required** - No internet link needed

- **Lower Cost** - Less expensive than offsite options

**Benefits:**
- **Fast Recovery** - Quick access to backup data
- **No Network Dependency** - Independent of network connectivity
- **Cost Effective** - Lower ongoing costs
- **Control** - Full control over backup media

**Limitations:**
- **Single Point of Failure** - Vulnerable to site disasters
- **Physical Security** - Requires physical security measures
- **Limited Redundancy** - No geographic redundancy
- **Disaster Risk** - Vulnerable to local disasters

### Offsite Backups
**Characteristics:**
- **Different Location** - Store data elsewhere
- **Network Transfer** - Transfer data over internet or WAN
- **Disaster Protection** - Available after local disasters
- **Remote Restoration** - Can restore from anywhere

**Benefits:**
- **Disaster Protection** - Protected from local disasters
- **Geographic Redundancy** - Multiple geographic locations
- **Remote Access** - Can restore from remote locations
- **Compliance** - Meet regulatory requirements

**Limitations:**
- **Network Dependency** - Requires network connectivity
- **Higher Cost** - More expensive than onsite options
- **Slower Recovery** - Longer recovery times
- **Security Concerns** - Data transmission security

### Hybrid Approach
**Best Practice:** Organizations use both onsite and offsite backups

**Benefits:**
- **Multiple Copies** - More copies of data
- **Multiple Options** - More restoration options
- **Risk Mitigation** - Reduce single points of failure
- **Flexibility** - Choose best option for each situation

## Backup Frequency

### Scheduling Considerations
**Question:** "How often do we backup?"

**Factors Affecting Frequency:**
- **Data Change Rate** - How often data changes
- **System Criticality** - Importance of system
- **Recovery Requirements** - Acceptable data loss
- **Storage Costs** - Cost of frequent backups

**Backup Schedules:**
- **Daily Backups** - Most critical systems
- **Weekly Backups** - Important systems
- **Monthly Backups** - Less critical systems
- **Multiple Backup Sets** - Different frequencies for different data

**Considerations:**
- **System Differences** - Different systems have different needs
- **Change Frequency** - Some systems change more than others
- **Storage Management** - Balance frequency with storage costs
- **Recovery Testing** - Regular testing of backup systems

## Encryption

### Data Protection
**Principle:** "A history of data is on backup media ... protect it"

**Encryption Requirements:**
- **All Data Protection** - Encrypt all backup data
- **Recovery Key** - Recovery key required to restore data
- **Offsite Priority** - Especially important for offsite backups
- **Cloud Backups** - Essential for cloud backup services

**Encryption Benefits:**
- **Data Confidentiality** - Protect sensitive data
- **Compliance** - Meet regulatory requirements
- **Theft Protection** - Protect against media theft
- **Eavesdropping Prevention** - Prevent data interception

**Implementation:**
- **Encryption at Rest** - Encrypt stored backup data
- **Encryption in Transit** - Encrypt data during transmission
- **Key Management** - Secure encryption key handling
- **Access Controls** - Control access to encrypted backups

## Snapshots

### Virtual Machine and Cloud Backups
**Primary Use:** Most commonly used within virtual machines and cloud-based infrastructures

**Snapshot Definition:**
- **Instant Backup** - An instant backup of entire system
- **Current State** - Save current configuration and data
- **Daily Updates** - Take snapshots every 24 hours for VMs
- **Fast Recovery** - Very fast recovery from snapshots

**Snapshot Benefits:**
- **Rapid Recovery** - Very fast recovery times
- **Point-in-Time Recovery** - Revert to any snapshot
- **Space Efficient** - Only store changes
- **Automated** - Can be automated

**Use Cases:**
- **Virtual Machines** - VM backup and recovery
- **Cloud Infrastructure** - Cloud-based system backups
- **Development Environments** - Development system backups
- **Testing** - Test environment restoration

## Recovery Testing

### Essential Validation
**Principle:** "It's not enough to perform the backup - you have to be able to restore"

**Testing Requirements:**
- **Disaster Simulation** - Simulate disaster situations
- **Restoration Testing** - Test restoration from backup
- **Application Testing** - Test restored applications
- **Data Validation** - Confirm restored data integrity

**Testing Methods:**
