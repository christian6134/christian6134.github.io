### **Define:** (Gap Analysis)

- Where you are compared with where you want to be
- "The gap between the two"

**Requires extensive research**
- Much to consider
- Can take weeks to months
- Extensive study to numerous participants


#### Choosing the framework
-----
- Work towards a known baseline
	- Set of internal goals
	- Formal Standards
- Determine the **end goal**



#### Evaluate people and processes
------
- Get a baseline of employees
	- Formal experience
	- Current Training
	- Knowledge of security policies / procedures

- Examine current processes
	- Research upstanding IT systems
	- Evaluate existing security policies



#### Compare and Contrast
----
**Analysis**:
- Comparison between systems in the environment
- Compare weaknesses with effective processes
- Compensate for weaknesses

**Create a detailed Analysis:**
- Break down broad security categories into little segments

### Final Analysis and Report
-----
- Final comparison
	- Detailed baseline objectives
	- A clear view of the current state

- Need a path to get from the current security to the new goal
	- Includes time, money and lots of change control

- Time to create gap analysis report
	- Formal description of the current state
	- Recommendations for meeting the baseline

- Color coded based off work needed to meet standardized baselines.
- Larger security requirements broken up into smaller implementations

- **Extensive detail / summary to implement security controls to better meet the goals of these baselines**
