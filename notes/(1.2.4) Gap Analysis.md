# 1.2.4 Gap Analysis

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the purpose and process of gap analysis
- Learn how to evaluate current security posture
- Identify steps to bridge security gaps

## Overview
Gap analysis is a systematic approach to identify the difference between where an organization currently is and where it wants to be in terms of security posture. It requires extensive research and provides a roadmap for improvement.

## Definition
**Gap Analysis:** Where you are compared with where you want to be - "The gap between the two"

**Requires extensive research:**
- Much to consider
- Can take weeks to months
- Extensive study to numerous participants

## Choosing the Framework
- Work towards a known baseline
  - Set of internal goals
  - Formal Standards
- Determine the **end goal**

## Evaluate People and Processes
- Get a baseline of employees
  - Formal experience
  - Current Training
  - Knowledge of security policies / procedures
- Examine current processes
  - Research existing IT systems
  - Evaluate existing security policies

## Compare and Contrast
**Analysis:**
- Comparison between systems in the environment
- Compare weaknesses with effective processes
- Compensate for weaknesses

**Create a detailed Analysis:**
- Break down broad security categories into little segments

## Final Analysis and Report
- Final comparison
  - Detailed baseline objectives
  - A clear view of the current state
- Need a path to get from the current security to the new goal
  - Includes time, money and lots of change control
- Time to create gap analysis report
  - Formal description of the current state
  - Recommendations for meeting the baseline

- Color coded based off work needed to meet standardized baselines
- Larger security requirements broken up into smaller implementations
- **Extensive detail / summary to implement security controls to better meet the goals of these baselines**
