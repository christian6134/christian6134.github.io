# 2.4.5 Physical Attacks

## Learning Objectives
- Understand physical security vulnerabilities
- Identify methods of physical attack
- Explain environmental attack vectors

## Overview
Physical attacks target hardware and infrastructure directly, bypassing network security controls. Physical access often provides complete system control.

## Physical Attack Methods

### Brute Force Attacks
**Definition:** Using physical force to overcome security barriers

**Examples:**
- Breaking through doors or windows
- Cutting through fences or barriers
- Using tools to bypass locks
- Forcing entry through weak points

**Protection:**
- Reinforced physical barriers
- Multiple layers of security
- Intrusion detection systems
- Security cameras and monitoring

### RFID Cloning
**Target:** Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems

**Common Targets:**
- Access badges and cards
- Key fobs and proximity cards
- Payment cards and transit passes

**Attack Process:**
- Read RFID card data using cloning devices
- Copy data to blank cards
- Use cloned cards for unauthorized access

**Protection:**
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Encryption on RFID cards
- Regular card rotation
- Physical security monitoring

## Environmental Attacks
**Target:** Infrastructure supporting technology systems

### Power System Attacks
- **Power Monitoring** - Disrupt electrical supply
- **Power Surge Attacks** - Damage equipment with electrical spikes
- **Power Outage Attacks** - Cause system failures

### HVAC System Attacks
**Target:** Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning systems

**Impact:**
- Overheating equipment causing failures
- Humidity damage to sensitive electronics
- Disruption of data center operations

### Fire Suppression System Attacks
**Methods:**
- Trigger false fire alarms
- Disable fire suppression systems
- Cause actual fires to damage equipment

**Protection:**
- Environmental monitoring systems
- Redundant HVAC systems
- Fire detection and suppression systems
- Regular environmental testing

## Key Principle
**"If you have physical access to a server, you have full control"**

Physical security is fundamental to overall security posture and cannot be compensated for by network security alone.
