# 1.2.5 Zero Trust

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the Zero Trust security model
- Explain the difference between Control Plane and Data Plane
- Describe Zero Trust architecture components
- Understand policy enforcement points

## Overview
Zero Trust is a security model that assumes no implicit trust and requires verification for every access request, regardless of location or user. It covers every device, process, and person with continuous verification.

## Zero Trust Architecture Components

**Control Plane:**
- Adaptive Identity
- Threat scope reduction
- Policy-driven access control
- Policy Administrator

**Data Plane:**
- Implicit trust zones
- Subject/System
- Policy enforcement point

## Zero Trust Definition
- Many networks are **relatively open** on the inside
  - Once through the firewall, **few security controls**
  - Allows unauthorized USERS / software to gain access to resources

**Define: ZERO TRUST**
- Covers every device, process and person
- Nothing is trusted, Everything is subject to verification
  - MFA
  - Encryption
  - System Permissions
  - Firewalls
  - Monitoring and Analysis

## Planes of Operation
Split network into functional places
- Can be physical, virtual or cloud components

### Data Plane
- Process frames, packets and network data
- Processing, forwarding, trunking, encrypting, NAT
- Firewalls

### Control Plane
- Manages actions of the data plane
- Define policies and rules
- Determine how packets should be forwarded
- Routing tables, Session tables, NAT Tables
- Firewall Rules

## Physical Architecture

- Separate into functional tasks

## Controlling Trust (Control Plane)

### Adaptive Identity
- Examine identity of an individual
- Apply security controls based on user info and other gathered information
- Consider source and requested resources
- Multiple Risk indicators:
  - Relationship to organization
  - Physical Location
  - Type of connection
  - IP Address
- Strengthen Authentication

### Threat Scope Reduction
- Limit access points to the network
- Entry points

### Policy Driven Access Control
- Combine the adaptive identity with a predefined set of rules

## Security Zones (Data Plane)
Where is someone connecting from?

Security is more than a one-to-one relationship

Where are you coming from, where are you going:
- Trusted, untrusted
- Internal, External
- VPN1, VPN5
- Marketing, IT, Accounting, Human Resources

Use zones to deny access based on rules
- Example, **Untrusted** to **Trusted** zone traffic

Some zones are **implicitly trusted**
- For example, **trusted** to **internal** zone traffic

## Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)
- Subjects and systems
  - End users, applications, non-human entities

### Gatekeeper
- Make decisions to allow or disallow access
- Consists of multiple devices working together (Abstracted)

### Policy Decision Point
- Process for making an authentication decision

### Policy Engine (Decision Maker)
- Evaluates requests
- Compares to predefined security policies
- Make a decision (Granted, Denied or Revoked)

### Policy Administrator (Messenger)
- Communicates with PEP
- Generates access tokens or credentials
- Tells the PEP to allow / Disallow Access
