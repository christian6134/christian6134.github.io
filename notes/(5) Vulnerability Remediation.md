- **Testing** - Test patches thoroughly
- **Rollback** - Have rollback procedures

**Best Practices:**
- **Regular Schedule** - Maintain regular patch schedule
- **Emergency Procedures** - Have emergency patch procedures
- **Testing Environment** - Test patches in isolated environment
- **Documentation** - Document all patch activities

## Insurance

### Cybersecurity Insurance Coverage
**Purpose:** Provide financial protection against cyber incidents

**Coverage Types:**
- **Lost Revenue** - Coverage for lost revenue due to incidents
- **Data Recovery Costs** - Coverage for data recovery expenses
- **Money Lost to Phishing** - Coverage for phishing losses
- **Incident Response** - Coverage for incident response costs

**Coverage Limitations:**
- **Not Comprehensive** - Does NOT cover everything
- **Exclusions** - Various exclusions and limitations
- **Deductibles** - Deductibles and coverage limits
- **Conditions** - Specific conditions and requirements

**Ransomware Considerations:**
- **Ransomware Prevalence** - Ransomware is prevalent threat
- **Coverage Specifics** - Specific coverage for ransomware
- **Payment Policies** - Policies regarding ransom payments
- **Recovery Costs** - Coverage for recovery costs

**Insurance Benefits:**
- **Financial Protection** - Financial protection against losses
- **Risk Transfer** - Transfer risk to insurance company
- **Incident Support** - Support during incident response
- **Compliance** - May help meet compliance requirements

## Segmentation

### Scope Limitation
**Purpose:** Limit the scope of vulnerability exploitation

**Segmentation Methods:**
- **VLANs** - Virtual Local Area Networks
- **Network Segmentation** - Physical network segmentation
- **Firewall Rules** - Firewall-based segmentation
- **Access Controls** - Access control-based segmentation

**When Patching Isn't Possible:**
- **Legacy Systems** - Systems that cannot be patched
- **Critical Systems** - Systems that cannot be taken offline
- **Third-Party Systems** - Systems controlled by third parties
- **Air Gaps** - Air gaps may be required

**Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs):**
- **Advanced Segmentation** - Advanced segmentation capabilities
- **Application Awareness** - Application-aware segmentation
- **Threat Protection** - Built-in threat protection
- **Policy Management** - Centralized policy management

**Segmentation Benefits:**
- **Attack Containment** - Contain attacks within segments
- **Lateral Movement Prevention** - Prevent lateral movement
- **Access Control** - Implement granular access controls
- **Compliance** - Meet compliance requirements

## Compensating Controls

### Alternative Mitigation
**Definition:** Compensate for vulnerabilities in other ways

**Compensating Control Methods:**
- **Service Disabling** - Disable problematic services
- **Access Revocation** - Revoke access to vulnerable systems
- **Security Control Modification** - Modify existing security controls
- **Firewall Rules** - Implement additional firewall rules

**Control Types:**
- **Preventive Controls** - Prevent exploitation
- **Detective Controls** - Detect exploitation attempts
- **Corrective Controls** - Correct issues after exploitation
- **Deterrent Controls** - Deter exploitation attempts

**Implementation Considerations:**
- **Business Impact** - Consider business impact
- **Functionality** - Maintain necessary functionality
- **User Experience** - Minimize impact on users
- **Maintenance** - Ensure controls are maintainable

## Exceptions and Exemptions

### Service Continuity
**Principle:** Provide the service while protecting data and systems

**Exception Management:**
- **Risk Assessment** - Assess risk of exceptions
- **Approval Process** - Formal approval process
- **Documentation** - Document all exceptions
- **Regular Review** - Regularly review exceptions

**Exemption Criteria:**
- **Business Justification** - Business justification required
- **Risk Mitigation** - Additional risk mitigation measures
- **Time Limits** - Time limits for exemptions
- **Review Requirements** - Regular review requirements

**Best Practices:**
- **Minimize Exceptions** - Minimize number of exceptions
- **Risk Management** - Manage risk of exceptions
- **Documentation** - Document all exceptions
- **Regular Review** - Regularly review and update exceptions

## Validation of Remediation

### Remediation Verification
**Question:** Vulnerability is now patched - does it really work?

**Verification Methods:**
- **System Coverage** - Did we cover all systems?
- **Patch Verification** - Verify patch installation
- **Functionality Testing** - Test system functionality
- **Security Testing** - Test security controls

### Rescanning
**Purpose:** Perform extensive vulnerability scanning
