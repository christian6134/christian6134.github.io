#### Put the change management process into action
-----
Execute the plan

- No such thing as a simple upgrade
	- Moving parts
	- Separate events
	- Lots of users
	- Complex process

Change management is concerned with "what" needs to change.
- The technical team is concerned with "how" to change it.


### Allow / Deny List
-----
Any application can be dangerous
- Vulnerabilities, trojan horses, malware

Security Policy can control app execution

**Allow List** (Whitelist)
- Nothing runs unless its approved 
- Very restrictive

**Deny List**
- Run any application except
- (Blacklist)
- Anti-virus, Anti-malware


### Restricted Activities
----
- **The scope of a change is important**
	- Defines exactly which components are covered

- **Change approval isn't permission to make any change**
	- Change control approval is very specific

- **The scope may have to be expanded during the change window**
	- Impossible to prepare for all possible outcomes

- **The change management process determines the next steps**
	- There are processes in place to make the change successful
	- Every understands the procedures



### Downtime
-----
Services will eventually be unavailable
- Change process can be **disruptive**
- Usually scheduled during **non-production hours**

If possible, prevent downtime
- Switch to secondary system, upgrade the primary, switch back

Minimize any downtime events
- Process should be as automated as possible
- Switch back to secondary if issues reappear
- Should be part of the backout plan

Send emails and calendar updates.



### Restarts
----
Common to require a restart
- Implement new configuration
- Reboot OS
- Can the system recover from a power outage?

Services
- Stop and restart the service or daemon
- May take seconds or minutes

Applications
- Close the application completely
- Launch a new application instance



### Legacy Applications
-----
Some applications were here before you arrived
- They'll be here when you leave
- 
No longer supported by the developer
- You're now the support team

Fear of the unknown
- Document the system
- Not as bad as you may think

Quirky
- Create specific processes and procedures



### Dependencies
----
- Complete A, you must Complete B
	- A service will not start without other active srevices
	- An application requires a specific library version
- Modifying one component may require changing or restarting other components
	- Dependencies can occur on various systems
	- Upgrade the firewall code
	- Upgrade the firewall management software


### Documentation
------
- Can be challenging to keep up with changes
	- Documentation can become outdated quickly
	- Require with the change management process
- Updating Diagrams
	- Modifications to network configurations
	- Address updates
- Updating policies/procedures
	- Adding new systems may require new procedures



### Version Control
----
- Track changes to a file or configuration data over time
	- Easily revert to a previous setting

- Many opportunities to manage versions
	- Router configurations
	- Windows OS patches
	- Application registry entries

- Not always straightforward
	- Some devices provide version control features
	- May require additional management software
