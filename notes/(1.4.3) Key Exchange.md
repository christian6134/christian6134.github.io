# 1.4.3 Key Exchange

**Logistical Challenge**
- "How can you share an encryption key across an insecure medium without physically transferring the key"

**Out of Band Key Exchange**
- Not sending the key over the network
- Telephone, courier, in-person, etc.

**In Band Exchange**
- It is on the network
- Protect the key with additional encryption
- Use **asymmetric** **encryption** to deliver a symmetric key
	- Encrypt the symmetric key with Asymmetric encryption


### Real time Encryption / Decryption
------
"We need fast security" ... Without compromising the security part

- Share a symmetric session key using asymmetric encryption
	- Client encrypts a random (symmetric key) with a server's public key
	- The server decrypts this shared key and uses it to encrypt data
	- This is the session key

- Implement session keys carefully
	- Need to be changed often (ephemeral keys)
	- Must be unpredictable


### Symmetric Key From Asymmetric Keys
------
- Use public and private key cryptography to create a symmetric key


### Key Exchange 
----------------
![[Private Key + Public Key.png]]

- Not performing any encryption or hashing
- Building the same symmetric key on both sides of the conversation
- Didn't send the key across the network.
