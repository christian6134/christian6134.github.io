# 2.3.6 SQL Injection

### Code Injection
---
**What is a Code Injection?**
- `Adding your own information into a data stream.`
- `Allowed because of bad programming`
	- `Application should handle input and output properly`
- **Different Types**
	- `HTML, SQL, HTML, XML`

### SQL Injection
-------
- Most common relational database management system language.
- Attackers can make their own SQL requests into the database
- Often executed in a web browser
	- Inject in a form or field

#### Example(s)

`SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '" + userName + "'";`
- Asking the database to select all information where the username is equal to the username that I am putting into the app
`SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'GARP'`
- If vulnerable to injection
`SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = `Professor` OR `**1` = `1**`
- OR 1 = 1 is the Injected code
