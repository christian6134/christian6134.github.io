### Hashes
-----
Represent data as a short string of text
- `Message Digest / Fingerprint`

**One way trip**
- NOT ENCRYPTION
- Cannot recreate data with just the hash
- Used to store passwords for **confidentiality**

**Verify a downloaded document is the same as the original**
- **Integrity**

Can be used to create a digital signature
- **Authentication**, **Non-repudiation, integrity**



#### Practical Hashing
----
- Verify a downloaded file
	- Hashes may be provided on the download site
	- Compare the `downloaded hash with the posted hash value`

- Password Storage
	- Instead of storing the password, store a **salted** hash
	- Compare hashes during the authentication process
	- Nobody every knows your actual password


##### Salt
----
- Random data added to a password when hashing
	- Makes it more difficult to brute force
	- Every user gets a different random salt
	- Same passwords -> Different hashes

- Rainbow tables 
	- Precompiled set of every possible input and associated hashes
	- They do not work with Salted Hashes
	- Work with Unsalted Hashes


#### Hash Collisions
-----
- Hash functions
	- take input of any size
	- create a fixed size string
	- message digest, checksum

- Hash should be unique
	- Different inputs should never create the same hash
	- This is called a **Collision**
	- Extremely rare occurence
	- Don't use `MD5` as collisions are possible



### Hash Examples
---
- SHA256 
	- 256 bits / 64 hexadecimal characters
	- Use applications to convert hashes
	- Make a change to the hash "small change", notice the vast difference in the hash
	- **One minor change causes a completely different output**



### Digital Signatures
---
- Hashes used to prove the message was not changed
	- Provide Integrity

- Prove the source of the message
	- Authentication

- Make sure the signature isn't fake
	- Non-repudiation

- **Sign the Digital Signature with the private key**
	- Message doesn't need to be encrypted
	- Nobody else can sign this
- **Verify with the public key**
	- Any change in the message will **invalidate the signature**



### Creating a Digital Signature
-----
![Creating Digital Signature](Photos/Creating-Digital-Signature.png)

Alice sends a message to bob "You're Hired Bob"
- Click checkbox to include digital signature

Email Client takes plaintext and sends it through a Hashing Function
- Now have a hash of plaintext

Email client encrypts HASH with private key
- Alice only has the private key, only one with this signature

Add digital signature to the plaintext (no encryption)

----------

Bob receives plaintext and digital signature
- He wants to verify integrity and proof of origin

Email Client Verifies Digital Signature
- Decrypts digital signature using Alice's public key 
- Results of hash of plaintext

Perform Hashing algorithm on plaintext
- Compare hashes
- Results = Good, Digital signature verified

Document is the same as what was sent
- Confirmed it came from Alice
- Integrity and Proof of Origin.
