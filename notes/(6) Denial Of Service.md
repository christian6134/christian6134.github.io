*What is DoS?*
- Occurs when a attacker forces a `service to fail.`
- Advantage of design failure or vulnerability
- Causes a system to be `unavailable`
- Could be a distraction / smoke screen

**Keep your systems up to date!**



*A Friendly DoS*
- Unintentional DoSing
- Example: Layer 2 loop without Spanning Tree
- Downloading multi-gigabyte distributions over a DSL line causes a `bandwidth DoS`



*DISTRIBUTED Denial of Service*
- Launch an army of computers to bring down a service
- `Multiple devices over the entire world`
- Uses all the `bandwidth` causing a traffic spike

**Botnets** (HIVE)
- Malware (robot networks) under the control of the attacker
- Can attack a particular web server 
- Coordinated Attack




*DDoS Reflection and Amplification*
- Turn a small attack into a big attack
- Reflect of another device or service
- Turn internet services against the victim

Use protocol with little authentication or checks that send lots of information.
- Example: DNS Amplification
	- Little information out, a lot of information returned. (Amplified)
