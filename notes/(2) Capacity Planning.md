# 3.4.2 Capacity Planning

## Learning Objectives
- Understand capacity planning principles and supply-demand balancing
- Explain people, technology, and infrastructure scaling strategies
- Describe web services, database services, and cloud services scaling
- Identify physical and cloud-based infrastructure considerations

## Overview
Capacity planning ensures systems can handle current and future demand by balancing supply with demand across people, technology, and infrastructure components.

## Supply-Demand Balancing

### Core Principle
**Goal:** Match supply to demand for optimal performance and cost

**Demand Scenarios:**
- **Too Much Demand** - Application slowdowns and outages
- **Too Much Supply** - Paying for unused resources
- **Balanced Approach** - Right amount of resources for demand

**Balanced Strategy:**
- **Right Amount of People** - Appropriate staffing levels
- **Apply Appropriate Technology** - Suitable technology solutions
- **Build Best Infrastructure** - Optimal infrastructure design
- **Cost Optimization** - Balance performance with cost

**Benefits:**
- **Performance Optimization** - Optimal system performance
- **Cost Efficiency** - Avoid over-provisioning
- **User Experience** - Consistent service delivery
- **Resource Utilization** - Efficient use of resources

## People Scaling

### Human Resource Management
**Characteristics:**
- **Easily Ramped Up/Down** - Flexible staffing adjustments
- **Time Consuming** - Requires time to add more staff
- **Skill Requirements** - Need appropriate skills and training
- **Cost Considerations** - Labor costs and benefits

**Scaling Strategies:**
- **Hiring** - Add permanent staff for long-term needs
- **Contractors** - Temporary staff for short-term projects
- **Outsourcing** - External service providers
- **Cross-Training** - Train existing staff for multiple roles

**Considerations:**
- **Recruitment Time** - Time to find and hire qualified staff
- **Training Requirements** - Time and cost to train new staff
- **Retention** - Keeping staff motivated and engaged
- **Knowledge Transfer** - Ensuring knowledge continuity

## Technology Scaling

### Scalable Technology Selection
**Principle:** Pick technology that can scale with demand

**Scalability Requirements:**
- **Horizontal Scaling** - Add more servers/instances
- **Vertical Scaling** - Increase server capacity
- **Elastic Scaling** - Automatic scaling based on demand
- **Load Distribution** - Spread load across multiple systems

### Web Services Scaling
**Implementation:**
- **Load Balancers** - Distribute load across multiple web services
- **Multiple Instances** - Run multiple web server instances
- **Auto-Scaling** - Automatically adjust capacity
- **CDN Integration** - Content delivery networks

**Benefits:**
- **High Availability** - Multiple instances provide redundancy
- **Performance** - Distributed load improves response times
- **Scalability** - Easy to add more instances
- **Cost Efficiency** - Pay only for what you use

### Database Services Scaling
**Clustering Strategies:**
- **SQL Server Clustering** - Multiple database servers
- **Database Splitting** - Split database to increase capacity
- **Read Replicas** - Separate read and write operations
- **Sharding** - Distribute data across multiple databases

**Implementation Methods:**
- **Master-Slave** - One master, multiple slaves
- **Master-Master** - Multiple masters with replication
- **Partitioning** - Split large tables across servers
- **Caching** - Use cache to reduce database load

### Cloud Services Scaling
**Characteristics:**
- **On-Demand Services** - Services available when needed
- **Unlimited Resources** - Scale as much as needed (with payment)
- **Elastic Scaling** - Automatic capacity adjustment
- **Pay-Per-Use** - Only pay for resources used

**Benefits:**
- **Cost Efficiency** - Pay only for what you use
- **Rapid Scaling** - Quick capacity adjustments
- **Global Availability** - Services available worldwide
- **Managed Services** - Cloud provider manages infrastructure

## Infrastructure Scaling

### Underlying Framework
**Components:**
- **Application Servers** - Server infrastructure
- **Network Services** - Network infrastructure
- **CPU Resources** - Processing power
- **Network Bandwidth** - Communication capacity
- **Storage Systems** - Data storage infrastructure

### Physical Devices
**Characteristics:**
- **Purchase Requirements** - Must buy hardware upfront
- **Configuration** - Manual configuration and setup
- **Installation** - Physical installation required
- **Maintenance** - Ongoing hardware maintenance

**Scaling Considerations:**
- **Capital Investment** - Large upfront costs
- **Lead Time** - Time to purchase and install
- **Capacity Planning** - Must predict future needs
- **Depreciation** - Hardware becomes obsolete

### Cloud-Based Devices
**Characteristics:**
- **Easier Deployment** - Virtual infrastructure
- **Rapid Provisioning** - Quick resource allocation
- **Elastic Scaling** - Automatic capacity adjustment
- **Managed Services** - Provider manages infrastructure

**Benefits:**
- **Cost Efficiency** - No upfront capital investment
- **Rapid Scaling** - Quick capacity adjustments
- **Global Reach** - Worldwide infrastructure
- **Automation** - Automated management and scaling

**Use Cases:**
- **Unexpected Demand** - Handle sudden capacity needs
- **Seasonal Variations** - Adjust for seasonal demand
- **Development/Testing** - Temporary infrastructure needs
- **Disaster Recovery** - Backup infrastructure
