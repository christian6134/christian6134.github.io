"Many things are connected to the internet (IoT devices)"

The security landscape has grown, there are security concerns for many devices.

`What is firmware?`
- The software inside of the hardware
- Vendors are the only ones who can fix their hardware
- Some vendors are lazy as fuck


### End-of-Life
------
Manufacturer stops selling the product
- May continue providing support

### End of Service Life (EOSL)
----
Manufacturer stops selling a product
- NO longer supporting the project
- No ongoing security patches or updates
- May have a premium-cost support option

### Legacy Platforms

`Some devices remain installed for a long time ... maybe too long`

`Legacy Device`
- Older OS
- Applications
- Middleware

Could be running EOL or EOSL software!
- Must assess risk with keep this device on the network
- May require additional security protections (if integral to the current infrastructure)
		- Additional firewall rules
