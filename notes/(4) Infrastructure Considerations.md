# 3.1.4 Infrastructure Considerations

## Learning Objectives
- Understand key infrastructure security considerations
- Explain scalability and performance security implications
- Describe disaster recovery and business continuity planning

## Overview
Infrastructure security requires careful consideration of scalability, performance, availability, and disaster recovery to ensure robust and resilient systems.

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
**Benefits:**
- Increased capacity
- Fault tolerance
- Load distribution
- Cost efficiency

**Security Implications:**
- **Attack Surface Expansion** - More systems to protect
- **Data Distribution** - Data across multiple systems
- **Access Management** - Scaling authentication systems
- **Monitoring** - Distributed security monitoring

### Vertical Scaling
**Benefits:**
- Simplified management
- Reduced complexity
- Single point of control
- Easier security implementation

**Security Implications:**
- **Single Point of Failure** - System vulnerability
- **Resource Constraints** - Limited scalability
- **Performance Impact** - Security overhead
- **Cost** - Expensive hardware requirements

## Performance Security

### Security vs Performance Trade-offs
- **Encryption Overhead** - CPU and network impact
- **Authentication Latency** - User experience impact
- **Monitoring Overhead** - System resource usage
- **Compliance Requirements** - Performance constraints

### Optimization Strategies
- **Hardware Acceleration** - Dedicated security processors
- **Caching** - Reduce authentication overhead
- **Load Balancing** - Distribute security processing
- **Asynchronous Processing** - Non-blocking security operations

## Availability and Reliability

### High Availability (HA)
**Components:**
- **Redundancy** - Multiple systems
- **Failover** - Automatic switching
- **Load Balancing** - Traffic distribution
- **Monitoring** - Health checks

**Security Considerations:**
- **Synchronization** - Security state consistency
- **Failover Security** - Secure failover processes
- **Data Integrity** - Consistent data across systems
- **Access Control** - Unified access management

### Disaster Recovery (DR)
**Planning Elements:**
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)** - Time to restore service
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)** - Acceptable data loss
- **Backup Strategies** - Data protection methods
- **Testing** - Regular DR testing

**Security Requirements:**
- **Secure Backups** - Encrypted backup data
- **Access Control** - DR site security
- **Data Integrity** - Backup verification
- **Compliance** - DR compliance requirements

## Business Continuity Planning

### Continuity Strategies
- **Hot Sites** - Fully operational backup facilities
- **Warm Sites** - Partially configured backup facilities
- **Cold Sites** - Basic infrastructure only
- **Cloud DR** - Cloud-based disaster recovery

### Security Integration
- **Identity Management** - Unified access across sites
- **Data Protection** - Consistent encryption
- **Monitoring** - Centralized security monitoring
- **Incident Response** - Coordinated response procedures

## Compliance and Governance

### Regulatory Requirements
- **Data Protection** - GDPR, CCPA compliance
- **Industry Standards** - PCI DSS, HIPAA
- **Security Frameworks** - NIST, ISO 27001
- **Audit Requirements** - Regular security audits

### Governance Framework
- **Policy Management** - Security policy enforcement
- **Risk Management** - Ongoing risk assessment
- **Change Management** - Controlled infrastructure changes
- **Vendor Management** - Third-party security requirements

## Cost Considerations

### Security Investment
- **Initial Costs** - Security tool implementation
- **Operational Costs** - Ongoing security operations
- **Training Costs** - Staff security education
- **Compliance Costs** - Regulatory compliance

### Cost Optimization
- **Automation** - Reduce manual security tasks
- **Consolidation** - Unified security platforms
- **Cloud Services** - Managed security services
- **ROI Measurement** - Security investment returns

## Best Practices
- **Risk Assessment** - Regular security risk evaluation
- **Defense in Depth** - Multiple security layers
- **Continuous Monitoring** - Ongoing security assessment
- **Incident Response** - Prepared response procedures
- **Staff Training** - Regular security education
- **Vendor Management** - Third-party security oversight
- **Compliance Management** - Ongoing regulatory compliance
