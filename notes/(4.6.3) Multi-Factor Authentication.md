# 4.6.3 Multi-Factor Authentication

## Learning Objectives
- Understand multi-factor authentication (MFA) concepts and authentication factors
- Explain "something you know" authentication methods
- Describe "something you have" authentication devices
- Identify "something you are" biometric authentication and "somewhere you are" location-based factors

## Overview
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enhances security by requiring multiple authentication factors to verify user identity, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access through compromised credentials by combining different types of authentication methods.
