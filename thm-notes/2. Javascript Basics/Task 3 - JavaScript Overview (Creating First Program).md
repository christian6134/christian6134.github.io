**Interpreted Language:**
- Code is executed directly in the browser without **prior compilation.**

Sample JS Code that Demonstrates:
- Defining a variable
- Understanding data types
- Control flow statements
- Writing Simple Functions

```
console.log("Hello, World!")

let age = 25;

if (age >=18) {
	console.log("You are an adult.");
} else {
	console.log("You are a minor.");


function greet(name) {
	console.log("Hello, "+ name + "!");
}

greet("Bob");
```

**Note:** JS is executed on the **client side** which makes it easy to inspect and interact with HTML directly within the browser.


### Google Chrome Console

```javascript
let x = 5;
