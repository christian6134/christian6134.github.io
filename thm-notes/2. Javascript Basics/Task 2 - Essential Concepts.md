### Variables
---------
- Allow containers for you to store data values in them
- Each variable has a name and a certain value -> we can reference it later

**3 Ways To Declare Variables**:
- `var`
- `let`
- `const`

Note: Both `let` and `const` are block-scoped and offer better visibility and control over variables within specific code blocks


### Data Types
-----------
Data types define the type of value a variable can hold
Examples:
- `string (text)`
- `number`
- `boolean`
- `null`
- `undefined`
- `object`
- `arrays/object`


### Functions
--------
Represents a block of code **designed to perform a specific task**
- Inside a function, **group code** that needs to perform a similar task

<script> 
	function PrintResult(rollNum)
		 { alert("Username with roll number " + rollNum + " has passed the exam"); 
		 
		  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) { PrintResult(rollNumbers[i]); 
		  }
	   </script>



### Loops
--------
Allows you to run a code block multiple times as long as the condition is `true`.
 - Common Loops
 - `for`, `while`, `do...while`



### Request / Response Cycle
---------
Is when a user's browser (client) sends a request to the web server, and the server responds with **requested information**.
