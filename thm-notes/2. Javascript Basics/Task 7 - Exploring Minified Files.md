*Define* **Minification**:
- We have understood how JS works and how we can read it when it is human-readable.

#### Minification:
- Process of compressing JS files by removing **all unnecessary characters** (spaces, line breaks, comments, shorten variable names).
- Helps reduce file size
- Improves **loading time** of web pages
- Makes code more compact and harder to read, functionality remains unchanged.


#### Obfuscation
- Used to make JS **harder** by **adding** undesired code
- Rename variables / functions to **meaningless names**
- Inserting Dummy Code


Code that has been **Obfuscated** can replace the readable code and maintain its functionality
