# Task 8 - Scripting

## Learning Objectives
- Understand PowerShell scripting concepts and benefits
- Learn script creation and execution techniques
- Master remote command execution with Invoke-Command
- Practice automation for cybersecurity applications

## Overview
PowerShell scripting involves writing and executing a series of commands contained in a text file (script). Scripts automate tasks that would otherwise be performed manually, saving time, reducing errors, and enabling complex operations. Scripting is essential for both offensive and defensive cybersecurity operations.

### Scripting Fundamentals

**Script Definition**
- Series of commands contained in a text file
- Automates manual PowerShell tasks
- Executes commands in sequence
- Enables complex operations

**Scripting Analogy**
Think of scripting as giving the computer a to-do list, where each line in the script is a task that the computer will carry out automatically.

### Benefits of Scripting

**Time Efficiency**
- Automates repetitive tasks
- Reduces manual intervention
- Enables batch operations
- Speeds up complex procedures

**Error Reduction**
- Eliminates human error in repetitive tasks
- Ensures consistent execution
- Reduces manual mistakes
- Improves reliability

**Complex Task Execution**
- Enables operations too complex for manual execution
- Supports conditional logic and loops
- Handles large-scale operations
- Integrates multiple commands

### Cybersecurity Applications

**Blue Team Operations**
- **Log Analysis**: Automated parsing and analysis of security logs
- **Anomaly Detection**: Scripts to identify unusual system behavior
- **IOC Extraction**: Automated extraction of indicators of compromise
- **Malware Analysis**: Scripts to reverse engineer malicious code
- **Intrusion Detection**: Automated scanning for signs of system intrusion

**Red Team Operations**
- **Enumeration**: Automated system and network reconnaissance
- **Remote Execution**: Scripts for executing commands on target systems
- **Obfuscation**: Crafting scripts to bypass security defenses
- **Attack Simulation**: Scripts to test system resilience and security

### Remote Command Execution

**Invoke-Command**
```powershell
Invoke-Command -ComputerName "TargetMachine" -ScriptBlock {Get-Service}
```
- Executes commands on remote systems
- Enables automation across multiple machines
- Used for remote administration and attack execution

**Script Execution on Remote Systems**
```powershell
Invoke-Command -FilePath "./script.ps1" -ComputerName "ServerName"
```
- Executes local scripts on remote computers
- FilePath parameter specifies script location
- Script runs on remote system, results returned locally

**Remote Command Examples**
```powershell
# Execute single command remotely
Invoke-Command -ComputerName "RoyalFortune" -ScriptBlock {Get-Service}

# Execute script file remotely
Invoke-Command -FilePath "./security-scan.ps1" -ComputerName "TargetServer"

# Execute multiple commands
Invoke-Command -ComputerName "RemotePC" -ScriptBlock {
    Get-Process | Sort-Object CPU -Descending | Select-Object -First 5
    Get-Service | Where-Object Status -eq "Running"
}
```

### Script Creation Best Practices

**Script Structure**
- Clear comments explaining purpose
- Error handling and validation
- Modular design for reusability
- Proper parameter usage

**Security Considerations**
- Validate input parameters
- Use appropriate execution policies
- Implement error handling
- Test scripts in isolated environments

**Example Script Structure**
```powershell
# Script: System-Security-Scan.ps1
# Purpose: Automated security assessment
# Author: Security Team

param(
    [string]$ComputerName = "localhost"
)

Write-Host "Starting security scan on $ComputerName"

# System information gathering
$systemInfo = Get-ComputerInfo
$processes = Get-Process
$services = Get-Service

# Generate report
Write-Host "Security scan completed"
```

### Practical Applications

**System Administration**
- Automated system maintenance
- Bulk user management
- Service monitoring and management
- Configuration management

**Security Operations**
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Incident response automation
- Log analysis and correlation
- Threat hunting operations

## Best Practices
- Start with simple scripts and build complexity
- Test scripts in safe environments first
- Use proper error handling and validation
- Document scripts with clear comments
- Follow secure coding practices
- Implement appropriate access controls
- Regular script review and updates
