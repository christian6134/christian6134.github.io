#### üîé Process Monitor (Procmon)

- **Purpose:**
    
    - Records **real-time system activity**:
        
        - File system reads/writes
            
        - Registry queries/modifications
            
        - Thread & process actions
            
- **Investigative Use:**
    
    - Track malware behavior in action.
        
    - Detect **credential dumping attempts** (e.g., `lsass.exe` targeted by **Mimikatz**).
        
    - Look for unusual access to system processes.
        
- **Example:**
    
    - Filtered view on `lsass.exe`.
        
    - Shows it accessing `lsasrv.dll` (legit).
        
    - Suspicious if **foreign process** attempts memory access.

#### üîé Process Explorer (Procexp)

- **Purpose:**
    
    - Advanced Task Manager.
        
    - Displays running processes, parent-child hierarchy, and user context.
        
    - Identifies DLLs loaded by a process.
        
- **Investigative Use:**
    
    - Verify **process lineage** (e.g., Word doc spawning PowerShell ‚Üí suspicious).
        
    - Validate PID and executable path.
        
    - Detect unusual spawns (e.g., `.lnk`, `.iso` dropping malware).
        
- **Example:**
    
    - Used to confirm **CFF Explorer** app process.
        
    - Shows **parent process**, confirming execution chain.

#### üîé HxD (Hex Editor)

- **Purpose:**
    
    - Directly view/edit raw file, memory, or disk bytes.
        
    - Supports searching, comparison, and data interpretation.
        
- **Investigative Use:**
    
    - Identify **file headers** (magic numbers).
        
    - Examine suspicious file structure.
        
    - Check for corruption or embedded payloads.
        
- **Example:**
    
    - File `possible_medusa.txt` opened.
        
    - Starts with `4D 5A` ‚Üí indicates a **Windows executable (MZ header)**.
        
    - Data Inspector helps interpret values as int/float/etc.

#### üîé CFF Explorer

- **Purpose:**
    
    - Inspects PE (Portable Executable) files.
        
    - Generates **hashes (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256)**.
        
    - Validates system file integrity.
        
- **Investigative Use:**
    
    - Confirm file authenticity.
        
    - Detect tampering (malicious injections in legit system files).
        
    - Compare hashes against threat intelligence feeds.
        
- **Example:**
    
    - File: `cryptominer.bin`
        
    - Type: **64-bit Portable Executable**
        
    - Built: **Sept 23, 2024**
        
    - Verified via hashes ‚Üí integrity checks.

#### üîé Wireshark

- **Purpose:**
    
    - Network traffic capture and analysis.
        
    - Shows protocol, source, destination, ports.
        
- **Investigative Use:**
    
    - Detect **C2 (command & control)** traffic.
        
    - Spot suspicious encryption (e.g., TLS used by malware to hide comms).
        
    - Analyze exfiltration attempts.
        
- **Example:**
    
    - Captured packets show:
        
        - **Protocol:** TLSv1.2 over TCP
            
        - **Info:** Encrypted transmission
            
    - Encrypted payload may mask malicious behavior.

#### üîé PEStudio

- **Purpose:**
    
    - **Static executable analysis** ‚Äî no execution required.
        
    - Extracts metadata, imports, libraries, entropy.
        
- **Investigative Use:**
    
    - Safe inspection of malware samples.
        
    - Spot **suspicious imports** (e.g., `VirtualAlloc`, `CreateRemoteThread`).
        
    - High entropy ‚Üí likely packed/encrypted file.
        
- **Example:**
    
    - File: `PsExec.exe` (dual-use tool).
        
    - **Entropy:** 6.596 (possible packing/encryption).
        
    - Built with Visual C++ 8.
        
    - Commonly abused for **lateral movement** in attacks.

#### üîé FLOSS (FireEye Labs Obfuscated String Solver)

- **Purpose:**
    
    - Extracts **obfuscated & hidden strings** from binaries.
        
    - Improves upon `strings.exe`.
        
    - Supports integration with reverse engineering tools (IDA Pro, Binary Ninja).
        
- **Investigative Use:**
    
    - Reveals hidden configs:
        
        - Hardcoded **IP addresses**
            
        - **C2 domains**
            
        - Registry keys, encryption keys
            
        - Error messages
            
    - Detects obfuscation patterns.
        
- **Example:**
    
    `floss .\cobaltstrike.exe`
    
    - Extracted **189 static strings** (file paths, API calls, URLs).
        
    - No dynamic decoded strings (suggests runtime obfuscation).
        
    - Indicates **Cobalt Strike beacon** likely present.
