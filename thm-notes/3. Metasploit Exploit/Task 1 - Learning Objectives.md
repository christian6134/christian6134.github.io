**BIG PICTURE:**
- We will learn how to use Metasploit for vulnerability scanning and exploitation. 
- How the database feature makes it easier to **manage penetration testing** engagements.
- We will look at generating payloads with `msfvenom`


### Learning Objectives
----
- How to scan target systems using Metasploit
- How to use the Metasploit Database feature
- How to use Metasploit to conduct a vulnerability scan
- How to use Metasploit to exploit vulnerable services on target systems.
- How `msfvenom` can be used to create payloads and obtain a Meterpreter session on the target system



### Note:
---
For all question that require using a **wordlist** (brute-force attack) 
- Use `/usr/share/wordlists/MetasploitRoom/MetasploitWordlist.txt`
