**Port Scanning**
- Metasploit has various modules to scan `open ports` on the target system and network. 
- **List potential port scanning modules** by using `search portscan`


**Some options
- **CONCURRENCY**: No. of targets to be scanned simultaneously.
- **PORTS**: Port range to be scanned 
	- Recall: Nmap scans from 1 to 1000
	- Metasploit will scan 1 to 10000
- **RHOSTS**: Target or target network to be scanned
- **THREADS**: No. of threads that will be used simultaneously... More threads, Faster scans


**UDP Service Identification**:
- `scanner/discovery/udp_sweep` module allows: Quick identification of services running over the UDP protocol.


**SMB Scans:**
- Scanning specific services
- Corporate network: `smb_enumshares` and `smb_version`
- See more....


**Exercises**
-----------------
(1) How many ports are open on the target system?
- `search portscan`
- `use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp`
- `set RHOST <target_ip>`
- `exploit`
- **Now,** count the TCP connections -> *5 OPEN **PORTS***


(2) Using the relevant scanner, what NetBIOS name can you see?
- `search NetBIOS`
- `use auxiliary/scanner/netbios/nbname`
- `set RHOST <target_ip>
- `exploit`
- NetBIOS name -> **ACME IT SUPPORT**


(3) What is running on port 8000?
- `search http_version`
- `use auxiliary/scanner/http/http_version`
- `set RPORT 8000`
- `exploit`
- Answer: `webfs/1.21`


(4) What is the "penny" user's SMB password? Use the wordlist mentioned in the previous task.
- `use auxiliar/scanner/smb/smb_login`
- `set RHOSTS <TARGET_IP>`
- `set SMBUser <penny>`
- `set PASS_FILE </usr/share/wordlists/MetasploitRoom/MetasploitWordlist.txt>`
- **RUN BRUTE FORCE password check** against wordlist -> password -> `leo1234`
