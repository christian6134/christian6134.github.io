# Task 1 - What is CyberChef?

## Learning Objectives
- Learn what CyberChef is and its capabilities
- Master how to navigate the CyberChef interface
- Understand common operations and their applications
- Learn how to create recipes and process data
- Practice with data transformation and analysis

## Overview
CyberChef is often described as the **"Swiss Army Knife for Data"** - a powerful web-based tool for performing a wide variety of data operations and transformations. It handles tasks ranging from **simple encodings like XOR or Base64** to **complex operations like AES Encryption or RSA Decryption**. CyberChef operates on **recipes**, which are a series of operations executed in order to transform input data.
