#### Types of Scans
-----
**1. Authenticated Scans**
- Credentials of subject host are provided to the vulnerability scanner.
- Identifies the vulnerabilities that can be exploited by the attackers `having access to the host.`
- Provides deeper visibility into the target system by `scanning its configuration and installed applications.`
- Example: Scanning an internal database by providing its credentials to the vulnerability scanner.


**2. Unauthenticated Scans**
- V-Scanner does not require the credentials, only requires `host IP Address.`
- Identifies vulnerabilities that can be exploited by `an external attacker` having `no access to the subject host.`
- Less resource-intensive and straightforward to setup
- Example: Scanning a public-facing website for vulnerabilities that any user can exploit


**3. Internal Scans**
- Conducted from within the network.
- Focuses on vulnerabilities that can be exploited within the network.
- These exploits are exposed once attackers get access to the network.


**4. External Scans**
- Identifies the vulnerabilities exposed to the attacker from the `outside of the network.`
