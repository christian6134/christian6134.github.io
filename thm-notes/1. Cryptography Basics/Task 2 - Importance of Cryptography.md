## Overview
Cryptography serves as the cornerstone of modern information security, providing essential mechanisms to protect data confidentiality and integrity in the presence of potential adversaries. Understanding the importance of cryptography is crucial for implementing effective security measures and complying with regulatory requirements.

### Fundamental Purpose

**Primary Objective**
- **Ensure secure communication in the presence of adversaries**
- Protect data from unauthorized access and modification
- Enable trusted communication over untrusted networks
- Provide security guarantees for digital systems

**Security Requirements**
- **Confidentiality**: Prevent unauthorized disclosure of information
- **Integrity**: Ensure data has not been altered or corrupted
- **Availability**: Maintain access to systems and data when needed
- **Authentication**: Verify the identity of communicating parties

### Defining Security

**Confidentiality Protection**
- Data remains secret from unauthorized parties
- Only authorized users can access sensitive information
- Encryption prevents unauthorized data disclosure
- Access controls limit data visibility

**Integrity Assurance**
- Data remains unchanged during transmission and storage
- Detection of unauthorized modifications
- Prevention of data corruption and tampering
- Verification of data authenticity

### Cryptography Definition

**Core Definition**
**Cryptography**: Practice and study of techniques for secure communication and data protection where we expect third parties to be present.

**Key Principles**
- **Third Party Protection**: Adversaries should NOT be able to disclose or alter message contents
- **Data at Rest**: Encrypted storage of sensitive information
- **Data in Motion**: Encrypted transmission of data over networks
- **Continuous Protection**: Security maintained throughout data lifecycle

### Regulatory Compliance

**Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**
- **Question**: What is the standard required for handling credit card information?
- **Answer**: Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)

**PCI DSS Requirements**
