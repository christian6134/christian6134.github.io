# Task 3 - Plaintext to Ciphertext

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the encryption and decryption process
- Learn key cryptographic terminology and definitions
- Master the relationship between plaintext, ciphertext, and keys
- Understand cipher algorithms and their functions
- Recognize security requirements for cryptographic systems

## Overview
The transformation from plaintext to ciphertext is the fundamental process of cryptography. Understanding this process, including the roles of algorithms, keys, and security requirements, is essential for implementing and analyzing cryptographic systems effectively.

### Encryption Process

**Plaintext Definition**
- **Plaintext**: Original, readable messages, images, text, or records
- Data in its unencrypted, human-readable form
- Information waiting to be encrypted
- Can include any type of digital data

**Encryption Function**
- **Plaintext** is passed through the **encryption function** along with a **proper key**
- **Encryption function** returns **ciphertext**
- **Encryption function** is part of the **cipher**
- **Cipher**: Algorithm to convert plaintext to ciphertext and vice versa

**Encryption Steps**
1. Input plaintext data
2. Apply encryption algorithm
3. Use cryptographic key
4. Generate ciphertext output

### Decryption Process

**Decryption Function**
- To recover plaintext, pass ciphertext along with **proper key**
- Use decryption function to restore original plaintext
- Reverse process of encryption
- Requires same algorithm and correct key

**Decryption Steps**
1. Input ciphertext data
2. Apply decryption algorithm
3. Use same cryptographic key
4. Generate original plaintext output

### Cryptographic Definitions

**Plaintext**
- Original, readable message or data before encryption
- Human-readable information
- Data in its natural form
- Input to encryption process

**Ciphertext**
- Scrambled, unreadable version of message after encryption
- Cannot extract information about plaintext except **approximate size**
- Encrypted data that appears random
- Output of encryption process

**Cipher**
- Algorithm or method to convert plaintext â†” ciphertext (both ways)
- Usually developed by mathematicians
- Public knowledge in most cases
- Defines the mathematical transformation

**Key**
- String of bits the cipher uses to encrypt or decrypt data
- Cipher tends to be public knowledge
- **Key must remain secret** unless **asymmetric**
- Determines the specific transformation applied

**Encryption**
- Process of converting plaintext to ciphertext using cipher and key
- Choice of cipher is disclosed
- Mathematical transformation of data
- Security depends on key secrecy

**Decryption**
- Reverse process of encryption
- Converting ciphertext back to plaintext using key
- Requires same algorithm and correct key
- Restores original data

### Security Requirements

**Key Security Principle**
- **Recovering plaintext without knowledge of key should be IMPOSSIBLE (Infeasible)**
- Cryptographic strength depends on key secrecy
- Algorithm can be public, but key must remain secret
- Security through mathematical complexity

**Cryptographic Strength**
- Resistance to brute force attacks
- Mathematical complexity of underlying problems
- Key length and entropy
- Algorithm design and implementation

### Practical Examples

**Symmetric Encryption**
- Same key used for encryption and decryption
- Fast and efficient for bulk data
- Examples: AES, DES, 3DES
- Key must be shared securely

**Asymmetric Encryption**
- Different keys for encryption and decryption
- Public key for encryption, private key for decryption
- Examples: RSA, ECC
- Enables secure key exchange

**Hybrid Systems**
- Combine symmetric and asymmetric encryption
- Use asymmetric for key exchange
- Use symmetric for bulk data encryption
- Best of both approaches

### Security Considerations

**Key Management**
- Secure key generation and storage
- Key distribution and sharing
- Key rotation and lifecycle management
- Protection against key compromise

**Algorithm Selection**
- Use proven, well-tested algorithms
- Avoid deprecated or weak ciphers
- Consider performance and security trade-offs
- Stay updated with cryptographic standards

## Best Practices
- Use strong, well-established cryptographic algorithms
- Implement proper key management practices
- Protect keys with appropriate security measures
- Regularly update cryptographic implementations
- Test and validate cryptographic systems
- Document cryptographic procedures and policies
