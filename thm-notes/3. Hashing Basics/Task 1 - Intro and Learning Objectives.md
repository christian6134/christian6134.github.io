**Scenario**: Downloaded a file and want to know if the received copy is identical to the original file.
- Compare hash values of the two files
	- If **equal** then with high certainty the files are identical


**Define:**
**Hash** **Value**: fixed-sized string or characters that is computed by a **hash function**.
**Hash Function:** takes an input of an arbitrary size and returns an output of fixed length (hash value)
