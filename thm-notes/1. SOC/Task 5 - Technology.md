*What does the Technology pillar refer to?*
- `Refers to the security solutions that aim to minimize the teams manual effort to detect and respond to threats.`

*How are security solutions useful*?
- `Centralize all the information of the devices or applications present in the network and automate the detection and response capabilities.`

### SIEM
-------
`What does SIEM stand for?`
- *Security Information and Event Management*

`What does the SIEM do?`
- *Collects logs from various network devices, referred to as log sources*
- *Detection Rules are configured in the SIEM solution, contains logic to identify suspicious activity*
- *Provides detection after correlating them with log sources and alerts us in case of a match with any rules.*
- `Machine Learning now...`

**NOTE:** The SIEM is only providing us with the `Detection Capabilities` within a SOC environment.


### Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
---------
- Provides SOC team with detailed and real-time (historical) visibility of the devices' and their activities.
- Operates on the endpoint level and can carry out automated responses
- Extensive detection capabilities for endpoints: Investigate them in detail and response with a few clicks.


### Firewall
------------
- Functions for network security and acts as a barrier between your internal and external networks (Internet)
- Monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and `filters any unauthorized traffic`
- Uses detection rules deployed


**NOTE:** Several other security solutions play unique roles in a SOC environment, such as Antivirus, EPP, IDS/IPS, XDR, SOAR, and more. The decision on what Technology to deploy in the SOC comes after careful consideration of the threat surface and the available resources in the organization.
