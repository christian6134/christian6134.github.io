# Task 1 - Learning Objectives

## Learning Objectives
- Build a baseline understanding of Security Operations Center (SOC)
- Learn about detection and response capabilities in SOC
- Understand the role of people, processes, and technology in SOC operations
- Practice with hands-on SOC exercises
- Master the fundamentals of SOC operations and monitoring

## Overview
A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a **dedicated facility operated by a specialized security team** that aims to **continuously monitor an organization's network and resources 24/7**. The primary goal is to **identify suspicious activity and prevent damage** before it impacts the organization. Understanding SOC operations is essential for defensive security professionals who need to protect organizational assets and respond to security incidents.
