**GUI v CLI cont.**
----------------------------
**Analogy:** Suppose you can order food 
1. From the Menu and wait to be served
2. Or cook the desired dish yourself
**In this case** the GUI is like ordering from the menu and then being served and the CLI means you would have to go to the kitchen (OS) and cook yourself (CLI)
- Using the CLI allows more power and control while carrying out tasks
