*How does this happen?*
- `When input is improperly santizied`
- `Attacker can manipulate input and write SQL queries that would get executed in the database and perform attacker's desired actions.`

**User Login Query Example**

`Username: John`
`Password: Un@detectable444`

Once you enter your username and password, the website will receive it, make an SQL query with your credentials, and send it to the database. 

```php
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'John' AND password = 'Un@detectab
```



### Performing SQLi
-------------
**Assume:** We don't know John's password.

abc' OR 1=1;-- -

How that injection works
- Close the password string
- The leading abc' ends the '…password…' literal in the SQL.
- Inject a tautology
- OR 1=1 makes the WHERE clause true regardless of the real password.

**Comment out the rest**
 - `;-- -` (semicolon + dash-dash-space) treats anything after as a comment, preventing syntax errors or extra checks.

**Resulting SQL query**

```sql
SELECT * 
  FROM users 
 WHERE username = 'John' 
   AND password = 'abc'       -- real check fails
   OR 1=1;                    -- always true
 -- -';                      -- rest is commented out```

**Effect**
The password = 'abc' check fails, but OR 1=1 succeeds.
Because one of the two conditions is true, the database returns John’s row
The attacker is effectively logged in as John without knowing his real password.

**Key takeaways**
- Quote closure: The ' after abc is crucial to exit the password literal.-
- Tautology injection: OR 1=1 forces a true result.
- Commenting: -- ensures no trailing SQL breaks the injection.
