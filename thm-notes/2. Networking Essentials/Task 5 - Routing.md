**Some Routing Algorithms**
--------------------------------------------------
**OPSF (Open Shortest Path First)**: 
- Allows routers to share information about network topology and calculate the most efficient paths for data transmission
- Routers exchange updates about the state of their connected links and networks
- Every router has a **complete map or topology** and can determine the best routes

**EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Protocol)**
- Combines different algorithms
- Routers share info about networks they can reach and the cost (bandwidth or delay) associate with those routes
- Routers choose most efficient paths for data transmission

**BGP (Border Gate Protocol)**
- Exchange of routing information
- Establish paths for data to travel
- Traversing Multiple networks

**RIP (Router Information Protocol**)
- Share information about networks they can reach and the number of hops
- Routers build tables, choosing routes with **least amount of hops**
