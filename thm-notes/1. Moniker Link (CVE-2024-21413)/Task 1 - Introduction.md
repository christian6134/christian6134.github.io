# Task 1 - Introduction

## Learning Objectives
- Understand Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities
- Learn about Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system
- Master how the Moniker Link vulnerability works
- Understand Outlook's Protected View security mechanisms
- Learn credential leakage techniques and detection methods

## Overview
This module focuses on CVE-2024-21413, a critical vulnerability affecting Microsoft Outlook that allows attackers to bypass security mechanisms and leak user credentials. Understanding this vulnerability is essential for both offensive security professionals and defenders who need to protect against such attacks.

### Remote Code Execution (RCE)

**RCE Definition**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: Vulnerability that allows an attacker to run arbitrary code on a remote system
- Can result in full system compromise
- One of the most severe types of vulnerabilities
- Enables complete control over target systems

**RCE Impact**
- Unauthorized system access
- Data theft and manipulation
- Lateral movement capabilities
- System compromise and persistence

### Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)

**CVE System**
- **CVE**: Term given to a publicly disclosed vulnerability
- Standardized identification system for security vulnerabilities
- Managed by MITRE Corporation
- Provides unique identifiers for tracking vulnerabilities

**CVE-2024-21413 Details**
- **Reference**: https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21413
- Affects Microsoft Outlook
- Critical severity vulnerability
- Allows credential leakage through Moniker Links

### Vulnerability Mechanism

**How the Vulnerability Works**
- Bypasses Outlook's security mechanisms when handling specific hyperlink types
- Exploits **Moniker Link** functionality
- Attacker sends email containing malicious Moniker Link to victim
- Results in Outlook sending user's **NTLM credentials** to attacker

**Attack Flow**
1. Attacker crafts malicious email with Moniker Link
2. Victim receives and opens email
3. Victim clicks malicious hyperlink
4. Outlook bypasses security mechanisms
5. NTLM credentials sent to attacker
