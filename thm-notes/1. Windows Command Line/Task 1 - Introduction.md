# Task 1 - Introduction

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the differences between GUI and CLI interfaces
- Learn the advantages of using Command Line Interface
- Familiarize with Windows CLI capabilities and basic commands
- Establish SSH connections for remote management

## Overview
The Command Line Interface (CLI) provides a powerful alternative to Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) for system administration and automation tasks. Understanding CLI fundamentals is essential for cybersecurity professionals who need to efficiently manage systems, troubleshoot issues, and automate security tasks.

### GUI vs CLI Comparison

**Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
- Visual interface with windows, icons, and menus
- User-friendly for beginners
- Higher resource consumption
- Limited automation capabilities

**Command Line Interface (CLI)**
- Text-based interface requiring command input
- Steeper learning curve but more powerful
- Lower resource usage
- Extensive automation possibilities

### Advantages of CLI

**Lower Resource Usage**
- Minimal memory footprint compared to GUI applications
- Faster execution of commands
- Efficient for server environments

**Automation**
- Scriptable commands for repetitive tasks
- Batch processing capabilities
- Integration with automation tools

**Remote Management**
- SSH connections for secure remote access
- Terminal-based administration
- Consistent interface across different systems

### Windows CLI Learning Objectives

**CMD.EXE Capabilities**
- Display basic system information
- Check and troubleshoot network configuration
- Manage files and folders efficiently
- Monitor running processes and services

### Establishing SSH Connection

**Basic SSH Syntax**
```bash
ssh user@10.10.111.165
```

**Connection Process**
1. Open terminal or command prompt
2. Use SSH command with username and IP address
3. Enter password when prompted
4. Access remote system command line

## Key Commands Preview
