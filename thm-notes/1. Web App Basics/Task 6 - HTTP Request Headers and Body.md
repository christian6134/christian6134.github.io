## Request Headers

Request Headers allow extra information to be conveyed to the web server about the request. Some common headers are as follows:

## Request Body

In HTTP requests such as POST and PUT, where data is sent to the web server as opposed to requested from the web server, the data is located inside the HTTP Request Body. The formatting of the data can take many forms, but some common ones are `URL Encoded`, `Form Data`, `JSON`, or `XML`.

- **URL Encoded (application/x-www-form-urlencoded)**  
    A format where data is structured in pairs of key and value where (`key=value`). Multiple pairs are separated by an (`&`) symbol, such as `key1=value1&key2=value2`. Special characters are percent-encoded.  
      
    **_Example_**  
    
    ```http
    POST /profile HTTP/1.1
    Host: tryhackme.com
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    Content-Length: 33
    
    name=Aleksandra&age=27&country=US
    ```
    
- **Form Data (multipart/form-data)**  
    Allows multiple data blocks to be sent where each block is separated by a boundary string. The boundary string is the defined header of the request itself. This type of formatting can be used to send binary data, such as when uploading files or images to a web server.  
      
    **_Example_**  
    
    ```http
    POST /upload HTTP/1.1
    Host: tryhackme.com
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
    Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW
    
    ----WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW
    Content-Disposition: form-data; name="username"
    
    aleksandra
    ----WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW
    Content-Disposition: form-data; name="profile_pic"; filename="aleksandra.jpg"
    Content-Type: image/jpeg
    
    [Binary Data Here representing the image]
    ----WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW--
    ```
    
- **JSON (application/json)**  
    In this format, the data can be sent using the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) structure. Data is formatted in pairs of name : value. Multiple pairs are separated by commas, all contained within curly braces { }.  
      
    **_Example_**  
    
    ```http
    POST /api/user HTTP/1.1
    Host: tryhackme.com
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
    Content-Type: application/json
    Content-Length: 62
    
    {
        "name": "Aleksandra",
        "age": 27,
        "country": "US"
    }
    ```
    
- **XML (application/xml)**  
    In XML formatting, data is structured inside labels called tags, which have an opening and closing. These labels can be nested within each other. You can see in the example below the opening and closing of the tags to send details about a user called Aleksandra.  
      
    **_Example_**  
    
    ```http
    POST /api/user HTTP/1.1
    Host: tryhackme.com
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
    Content-Type: application/xml
    Content-Length: 124
    
    <user>
        <name>Aleksandra</name>
        <age>27</age>
        <country>US</country>
    </user>
    ```
```
