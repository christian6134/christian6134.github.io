When you interact with a web application, the server sends back an **HTTP response** to let you know whether your request was successful or something went wrong. These responses include a **status code** and a short explanation (called the **Reason Phrase**) that gives insight into how the server handled your request.

### Status Line

The first line in every HTTP response is called the **Status Line**. It gives you three key pieces of info:

1. **HTTP Version**: This tells you which version of HTTP is being used.
2. **Status Code**: A three-digit number showing the outcome of your request.
3. **Reason Phrase**: A short message explaining the status code in human-readable terms.

Since we already covered HTTP Versions in Task 5, let’s focus on the **Status Codes** and **Reason Phrases** here.

### Status Codes and Reason Phrases

The **Status Code** is the number that tells you if the request succeeded or failed, while the **Reason Phrase** explains what happened. These codes fall into five main categories:

**Informational Responses (100-199)**  
These codes mean the server has received part of the request and is waiting for the rest. It’s a "keep going" signal.

**Successful Responses (200-299)**  
These codes mean everything worked as expected. The server processed the request and sent back the requested data.

**Redirection Messages (300-399)**  
These codes tell you that the resource you requested has moved to a different location, usually providing the new URL.

**Client Error Responses (400-499)**  
These codes indicate a problem with the request. Maybe the URL is wrong, or you’re missing some required info, like authentication.

**Server Error Responses (500-599)**  
These codes mean the server encountered an error while trying to fulfil the request. These are usually server-side issues and not the client’s fault.

### Common Status Codes

Here are some of the most frequently seen status codes:

**100 (Continue)**  
The server got the first part of the request and is ready for the rest.

**200 (OK)**  
The request was successful, and the server is sending back the requested resource.

**301 (Moved Permanently)**  
The resource you’re requesting has been permanently moved to a new URL. Use the new URL from now on.

**404 (Not Found)**  
The server couldn’t find the resource at the given URL. Double-check that you’ve got the right address.

**500 (Internal Server Error)**  
Something went wrong on the server’s end, and it couldn’t process your request.
