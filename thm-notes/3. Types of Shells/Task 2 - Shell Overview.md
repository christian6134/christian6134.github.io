### What is a Shell?
---------
`Software that allows a user to interact with an Operating System`.
- This can be GUI 
- Usually CLI
- Depends on the OS of the target system

`What are some activities (commands) that an attacker can execute on a target Operating System?`
- **Remote System Control**: allows the attacker to execute commands or software remotely in the target system.
- **Privilege Escalation**: If initial access through a shell is limited or restricted, attackers can explore ways to escalate privileges to more elevated or administrative access.
- **Data Exfiltration**: Once attackers have access to execute commands through an obtained shell, they can explore the system to read and copy sensitive data from it.
- **PersistenceÂ and Maintenance Access**: Once shell access is obtained, attackers can create access through users and credentials or copy backdoor software to maintain access to the target system for later usage.
- **Post-Exploitation Activities**: After access to a shell is granted, attackers can perform a wide range of post-exploitation activities, such as deploying malware, creating hidden accounts, and deleting information.
- **Access Other Systems on the Network**: Depending on the attacker's intentions, the obtained shell can be just an initial access point. The goal can be to hop through the network to a different target using the obtained shell as a pivot to different points in the compromised system network. This is also known as pivoting.
