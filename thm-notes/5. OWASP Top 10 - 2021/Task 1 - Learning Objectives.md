**OWASP**
The Open Web Application Security Project is a nonprofit foundation focused on understanding web technologies and exploitations and provides resources and tools designed to improve the security of software applications.


This room breaks each OWASP topic down and includes details on the vulnerabilities, how they occur, and how you can exploit them. You will put the theory into practice by completing supporting challenges.
