#### Installation

Install Burp Suite using the appropriate method for your operating system. On Windows, run the executable file, while on Linux, execute the script from the terminal (with or without sudo). If you choose not to use `sudo` during installation on Linux, Burp Suite will be installed in your home directory at `~/BurpSuiteCommunity/BurpSuiteCommunity` and will not be added to your `PATH`.

The installation wizard provides clear instructions, and it is generally safe to accept the default settings. However, it is always recommended to review the installer carefully.

With Burp Suite successfully installed, you can now launch the application. In the next task, we will explore the initial setup and configuration.
