**Proxy:
- Enables interception and modification of requests and responses while interacting with web applications.

	- Craft payloads through trial and error (SQL Injection) or testing functionality of an endpoint and vulnerabilities.

**Intruder:**
- ~Rate Limitations
- Allows for spraying endpoints with requests
- Used in brute-force attacks or *fuzzing endpoints*

**Decoder**:
- Data transformation
- Decode captured information or encode payloads before sending them to the target.

**Comparer:
- Enables comparison of two pieces of data at either the word or byte level.
- Send large data segments to a comparison tool

**Sequencer**:
- Used when assessing randomness of tokens (cookie values)
- Check for secure randomness otherwise vulnerable.
